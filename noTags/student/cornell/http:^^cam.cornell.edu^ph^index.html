 Who am I? 


I was a Ph.D. student (1991-1996) in the  Center for Applied Mathematics,  which
is housed in  Frank
H.T. Rhodes Hall  at  Cornell
University.   My thesis advisor was 
Steve Vavasis .  Other members of my committee were  Nick
Trefethen  and 
Al Schatz.  My research interests fall in the areas of

 numerical linear
algebra


 scientific computing


 optimization

I am currently working as a postdoc with  Juan Meza  in the  Scientific Computing Department
 at  Sandia National
Laboratories  in Livermore, CA.
 Here is my  resume  and a  statement of research goals .



 Tech Reports 




"Complete orthogonal decomposition for weighted least squares", 
with 
S.A. Vavasis , to appear in SIAM J. Matrix Anal. App.




 "Stable and efficient solution of
weighted least-squares problems with applications in interior point
methods",  Ph.D. Thesis.
