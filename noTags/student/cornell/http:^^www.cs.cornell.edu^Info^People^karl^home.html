My current research interests are micro robotics, manipulation, and
assembly.
At the Cornell Nanofabrication 
Facility I am building 
microfabricated actuator arrays 
that implement
micro manipulation strategies.
More generally I am interested in
new devices for handling and
assembling parts,
and manipulation strategies with
programmable force vector fields.
I have also investigated 
design automation for micro structures.

Earlier work at the 
University of Karlsruhe, 
Germany, has included the development of better 
graph layout algorithms.

My thesis advisor is Professor
Bruce Donald,
who is one of the founders and directors of the Cornell
 
Computer Science Robotics and Vision Laboratory.
My project is in close collaboration with Professor 
Noel MacDonald
and his
research group.

If I am not in my office or the 
Nano Lab, I may be working out
in our Tae Kwon Do club, 
or you may find me at the Lindseth 
climbing  wall.
