 Research Interests  
I work with the 
Information Capture and Access
research group on document analysis.  My
long-term goal is to provide support for
sophisticated electronic document manipulation
tools for indexing, browsing, linking, etc.
My primary interest is in discovering logical
structure in arbitrary electronic documents.
The goal is to take an electronic document
representation as input and return a hierarchy
of logical pieces of the document as output.
For example, given a scanned-in or postscript
version of a technical report, I would like to
be able to divide it into sections, paragraphs, etc.
Similarly, in a business letter, the address headings,
body, and closing should be identifiable.
This problem has two primary components:  
segmentation
(dividing the document into logical pieces) and
classification
(categorizing the pieces).
It also raises the questions of evaluation
(previous work differs in descriptions of the correct hierarchy), 
types of logical structures,
and theoretical limitations.
The task is relevant to two of Bruce Croft's
top 10
research issues for information retrieval
(in the 
November
1995 issue of D-Lib Magazine):
number 5, "interfaces and browsing," and number 3,
"efficient, flexible, indexing and retrieval."  Determining
logical structure enables flexible, hierarchical browsing; doing so
in a general way supports system flexibility and handling of
multiple document types.
