Dan's Cyber Abode


Greetings,

Ye travelers through digital space,
Welcome to mine humble home. 
Prithee, gentles all,
Surf no further than this shore.
Instead, blink thy teary eyes,
Rest thy weary, keys and mice- borne hands,
And make thyselves home in mine abode.

About Myself...

Faith

They say that hardly is Faith a prize,
  in this ferro-concrete age.
For sayings of wise men we scorn,
  bending instead our ears,
  to lawyer's tones,
  and scientists' words.
What needs have we, then,
  of a God,
  unseen, unheard, 
  and untouchable?
Yet, in the silence of night,
  how we dread the unknown,
  how we question the uncertain,
  how we yearn for true Faith.

Love

Warm Friendships - Ah,
Mindless Infatuations - Huh,
Sensual Romances - Hmm,
Burning Passions - Oh -
Love O Love O Love...
(soft sigh)...

Beloved...

Hope

Myth favored not beauteous Pandora,
and ever did men place her at fault,
for her all too human role,
which released the dreaded demon Hope.
Many are those who were led astray,
by a few pretty glimmers of false Hope.
They treaded the torturous, broken roads,
amidst thorns, darkness, and filthy souls.
Disease, pain, and horrors they suffered,
only to reach a feared end in tears.
Yet I say that Pandora cannot be blamed,
for ever as her deeds were told,
burning hope in our hearts take hold,
and the world would never be as of old,
ever frozen in sad sad Misery's cold.

To that which springs eternal...
