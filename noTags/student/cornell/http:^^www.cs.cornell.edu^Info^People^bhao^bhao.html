From inside Cornell, try the Net Flea.

I'm a forth-year Ph.D. student in
Computer Science at Cornell,
working on code synthesis for massively parallel processors.

My advisor is Dr. Richard Zippel whom I first heard from Dr. George Taylor
when I was at Sun Microsystems.

My family is in the San Francisco Bay Area.  You can find more information about
the area by reading its local newspapers.
Don't forget to check out its
gorgeous weather.
