Yama's Den





Yama's Den : Hell!
According to Hindu mythology, Yama is the God of Death. He comes down
to earth to give a ride to those who are on their way to Heaven or Hell.
Though he's kind of impartial, its better not to mess with him.....

CS418 - Ride to Heaven 

This is a train ride simulation for the 418 graphics final project.

CS516 - Parallel Ray Tracing in CC++ 

Proposal 
Virtual Reality RailRoad Simulation 
This is my Masters project. It involves the simulation of a railroad
system including the trains the tracks, the switches, stations, landscape,
and user interaction in a two-wall CAVE environment with Stereo vision.
The simulation is done on a 20 processor SGI Onyx system. The software
is written in C++, using the OpenInventor
3D graphics library from Silicon Graphics
. The simulation includes on-the-fly landscape generation, dynamics of
the train and the environment and fly throughs.

Image Compression Chip
Developed an Image Compression chip for the VLSI course. The chip basically
compresses any 8 bit data stream using the LZW compression algorithm. This
algorithm is better suited for images. The chip controls an external cache
CAM (content addressable memory) where it stores patterns from the input
stream in the hope that the patterns might occur again. The chip is capable
of compressing data at the rate of 1 byte in 80 nano seconds. There's no
way a software routine can compress data at that speed.

PyraMania 3D
This is a 3D game developed for the Software Engineering course. Its
written in C++ and uses Tcl for some of the interface and XLib for the
3D rendering. You can take a look at a snapshot of the game screen.
