Welcome!  That's the CS Department-issue picture of me to the left.  You are seeing a not-quite-up-to-date page for frames challenged web viewers.

I'm from Syosset, New York (one of those towns on Long Island) and received my Bachelor of Science degree here in December, 1994.  After working for a few months in California, I decided to come back here in the fall and am currently working on a Master of Engineering degree.  Why did I leave the "land of sun" to come back to Ithaca?  Maybe I missed the seasons here - rain, wind, snow, ice....  (Actually, I got more than enough rain while I was in Santa Barbara).  Anyway, I plan to graduate in May, 1996.

I'm currently working on my MEng project with Prof. Ramin Zabih at the Cornell Robotics and Vision Lab (CSRVL).   If you are interested in the topic of motion video segmentation or just general video processing, here is a paper which relates to my research in the area.
