Since you are here, maybe you'd like to  know a little about me? I doubt it. Anyway, currently I'm a Master of Engineering student in the Department of Computer Science  at  Cornell University. Cornell is located at Ithaca, central New York, a gorgeous place to live except in winter. Last year, I received my M.Sc in Applied Physics from  New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersey.

I was brought up in the beautiful campus of Tsinghua Unviersity ,  Beijing,  China. I also received my B.Eng in Engineering Physics from there. I want to say hi to all my friends in China. I miss you.
