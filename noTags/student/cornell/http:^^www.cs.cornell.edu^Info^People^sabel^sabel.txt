 Professional Information 

I did my doctoral research with Professor

Keith Marzullo, of the University of California at San Diego,
on failure detection in asynchronous distributed systems.  For
more research on failure detectors, see
 Tushar Chandra's
Failure Detection Page. 

I finally finished my  thesis:
 Approximating Perfect Failure Detectors in Asynchronous
Distributed Systems. 
 Publications 
 Election Vs. Consensus in Asynchronous Systems
