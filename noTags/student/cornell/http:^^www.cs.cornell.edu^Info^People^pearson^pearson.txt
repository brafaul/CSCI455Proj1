 Research Interests 

My thesis investigates highly scalable parallel computers consisting
of very simple processors connected in a 3-dimensional mesh.
The guiding vision of this work is of a time, perhaps 50 years hence,
in which materials science has taken the place of computer architecture,
and computers are crystals, with each processor a molecule in the lattice.
Long before this goal can be realized, we can and should prepare for the
ubiquitous parallelism it will offer.  Our algorithms must heed the laws
of physics and pay attention, as chip designers do now, to spatial layout
and the (currently hidden) cost of communication.  This can be accomplished
by designing our algorithms for a 3-D mesh.

To pursue this vision requires both theoretical and practical work.
So far, my work could be characterized as a feasibility study: I
have produced a 3-D cellular architecture which could
be efficiently realized with current hardware, a simulator for this
architecture, algorithms, programs, and an operating system design
for general-purpose computing.
(I believe that general-purpose computers, not problems like protein
structure, are the grand challenge of parallel architecture.  Parallel
computational power will not really succeed until it becomes a commodity
and is sold for desktop machines or video games.)

Directions for future research include VLSI implementation of this architecture
and the design of a programming language.  Most widely-used languages hide
the details of the machine's instruction set, but reflect the underlying
Von Neumann architecture.  I believe that this connection to the architecture
has been a good thing for algorithm design, and to really exploit parallel
machines we need a language for which the costs of operations are as easy
to estimate as they are for C++ on a Von Neumann machine.
