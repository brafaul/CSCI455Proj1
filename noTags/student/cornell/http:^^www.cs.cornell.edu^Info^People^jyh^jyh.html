I am a graduate student at Cornell in the Computer Science Department,
under the supervision of Robert
Constable.
Here's a summary of my current status:




My interests include the theory and practice of programming languages.
There is a great resource at CMU under The
Fox Project Home Page, especially Mark
Leone's resources for programming language research.

My own work in programming languages is mainly software verification.
One of the tools I use for specification is type theory. I use the formal
system Nuprl,
developed here at the Cornell University
Department of Computer Science. In my research I make use of higher-level
modules and abstract data types, and relate them to type-theory. 
Here are some recent papers:


Some papers I have published at Cornell

A bibliography of some papers I published
at Bellcore 

I also have some slides of talks I have
given in the Nuprl seminar. The slides can be pretty technical, but they
give an overview of the work I've done at Cornell.

Some interests I have include: 

The Fine Arts. Here is a gallery
of mine. There are a lot of other resources for fine arts on the Web. Try
The Art Net Web, or
The FineArt Forum.

CUCS
Hockey 
Backcountry. Take a look at The
Backcountry Home Page. 

I perform a few services for the department: 

Publicly-maintained
Software Czar; 
Hockey and hockey-equipment czar. Go back to Hockey
for more info. 
Theatre czar. Here is the schedule for
the Cornell Center for the Theatre Arts.
