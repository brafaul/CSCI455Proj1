William W. Lee








 
 
Hi, I am from New Jersey, Exit 8A, 10 minutes away from 
Princeton.
I am a Master student in Computer Science
at Cornell University.
I have a BS degree in Computer Engineering
and Mathematics/Computer Science
from Carneige Mellon University, where I did
research projects for Engineering Design Research Center,
and Robotics Institue.
Then I spent a year writing an operating system, XSROS, on HPUX for 
Motorola at
Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.
Besides sleeping and school, I work on projects like Optimal Parallel MPEG Encoder , CORNELLopoly, $500 Network Computer, and Database Sector Analysis with my research partners at the Systems Lab.






I compete in 4.0 USTA
tennis 
tournments in South Florida 
but I could never win.  Somehow it is the parties that I enjoy after weekly matches.  There 
are many very beautiful places to play tennis in 
South Florida. 
Here are some of my faviorite ones:

Boca Raton
Key West (Gets very hot)
Coral Springs (Where I lived)







I have a collection of piano concertos from Beethoven, Chopin, Gershwin, Liszt,
Mendelssohn, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, Ravel, Tchaikovsky.  I also collect violin
concertos.  As you can probably guess by now, I am a "concerto" type of guy.
I even wrote my graduate school application essay based on a piano concerto.
That's probably one of the reasons why I got rejected by my own school.
