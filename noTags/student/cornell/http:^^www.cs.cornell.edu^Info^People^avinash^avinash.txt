Pente - A networked game of skill

Pente (meaning five) is a board game of skill requiring 2 players. The objective of the game is to get five points or get five of your own pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Points can be earned by trapping the opponents pieces between your pieces. Only an even number of pieces can be trapped, i.e. either 2 or 4. For each pair of pieces trapped, you get 1 point. The player reaching five points first wins.
