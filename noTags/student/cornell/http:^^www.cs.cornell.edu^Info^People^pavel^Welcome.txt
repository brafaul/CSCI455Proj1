Welcome to my  Home Page

I invite you to learn more 
about me and 
my location in the cyberspace and 
the real world. Look at my work for Nuprl project 
and if you are tired take a rest at my 
Art Gallery or visit my Cinema, look at some of my photos, or
play a game on Java that I have written one Sunday.

Or just send me e-mail and go to 
some other place.
