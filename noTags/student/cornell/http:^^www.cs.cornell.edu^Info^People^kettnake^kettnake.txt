if i publish it, it is true.


some of my writings
i've not had much published, but i have written some things i'm proud
of.  some of them have been flames of mine, and others have been more
thought out.  as a conscientious objector to all armed conflict, my
first published letter was published in the grand rapids press a few
years back during the gulf war.  since that time, however, i've
started keeping more of my work online.

lest you wonder, i also do write poetry and other things.  but i'd
probably rather be famous as an essayist anyhow--i like to argue.

so here's some of my writings:

there's a dreadful mess going on in byron center, which is a
suburb 5 miles from where i went to high school.  so i wrote a letter.
the unabomber suspect was a mathematician.  so all mathematicians
are suspected terrorists?  i don't think so...so i wrote a letter to the editor of my newspaper.
