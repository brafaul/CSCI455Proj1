 Me 


 Warning: Under Construction



I am a PhD student in Computer Science and my areas of interest are Distributed Systems and 
Multimedia Systems. I did my Bachelor's degree in Computer 
Systems Engineering from N.E.D. University of Engineering and Technology 
in Karachi, Pakistan. Since then, which was in 1992, I had been working 
in AT&T Global Information Solutions as a Systems Engineer. At present, I am on
a study leave for my master's program here at Cornell. 

My job responsibilities with AT&T included:


 Systems/Application Programming

 Unix System Administration Support

 Education

 Network Management and Installation


So far I've worked on a number of interesting projects here at Cornell. I plan to put them up online some good day (hopefully before year 2000).


Publications

The following interest me too:
