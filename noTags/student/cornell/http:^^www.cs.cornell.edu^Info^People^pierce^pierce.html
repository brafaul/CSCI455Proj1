 Personal Stuff 

I am a second year PhD student in computer science.



My most recent home is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, although my family
currently resides in Reading, Pennsylvania.  
Reading  is a city approximately halfway between Philadelphia and
Harrisburg.  It is famous for its shopping outlets; otherwise, you
never want to go there.  However, 
Pittsburgh  is a great place, as many of you already know, since
it is impossible to fly in or out of Ithaca without going through
Pittsburgh.
