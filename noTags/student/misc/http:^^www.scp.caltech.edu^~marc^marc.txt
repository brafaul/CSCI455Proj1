I am a graduate student at the California
Institute of Technology  
(Caltech), studying for my Ph.D. in
Computer Science.  I work in the
Scalable Concurrent Programming (SCP)
lab. 
NEWS: Along with the entire SCP Laboratory, I will be moving to 
Syracuse University in mid-December.  Stay tuned for my new address, phone number, etc.  

Current Projects


Hawk: Plasma simulation for microelectronics fabrication
 The SCP Grid Library:  A library for unstructured parallel solvers.

The SCP Structures Library, a 
library for hash tables, linked lists, etc.

This is an organization that I co-founded in 1991, and for which I served as President during the 92-93 and 93-94 school years.

The NetMarket Company
This is a company that will let you order CD's, flowers, etc. over the
net, with a very nice Mosaic interface.  It was founded by some acquaintances
of mine at Swarthmore.  Check it out.
