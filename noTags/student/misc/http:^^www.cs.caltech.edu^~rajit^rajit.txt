I work on

Apart from that, I am interested in a number of other subjects including
scalable parallel computing, formal methods, programming language semantics, 
neural networks, and information theory.

 Other:
 You can find out a bit about
me
if you like. Once in a while (when I get really really bored) I write 
scripts to do various things on the
www.  
Here are some
quotations
I'd like to share.
