Current Projects


 Evaluation of 
CaMILE in ME3110 -- Creative Decisions and Design.
This project also includes Mark Guzdial, Farrokn Mistree, Janet Allen,
David Rosen, Jorge Vanegas, Wendy Newstetter, Jennifer Turns and Jason
Higgenbotham.

 Educational Infrastructure: This project involves developing
courseware, tools for courseware development and analysis of results.
Focus is on use of multimedia, hypertext and collaborative learning.
Other team members include John Stasko, Mark Guzdial and Colleen Kehoe.

 Use of W3 for Collaboration: See  WebCaMILE  for a current
example of this interest. Also interesting is the  XTango animation page . XTango is an interactive
Algorithm Animation system which you may use if you are running X-Windows.

 I am working on a  tutorial  for
using Perl to generate HTML on the fly.  These are based on a session
given to the Educational Infrastructure Group.
