James F. O'Brien






	  I am a Doctoral Student in the          
	  College of Computing
	  at the
          Georgia Institute of Technology,
	  and a member of the 
	  Graphics, Visualization, and Usability Center.
	  I spend most of my waking hours in the 
	  Animation Lab
	  where I like to stare at computer monitors.
          
  
	  My primary area of research involves the physically based simulation of
	  complex deformable systems to generate
          Secondary Motion
	  for use in computer generated animation.  
	  




          My wife, Heather.

Recent Research Projects:
