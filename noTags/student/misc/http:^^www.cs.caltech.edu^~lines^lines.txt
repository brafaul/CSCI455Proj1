Asynchronous VLSI
 I do asychronous digital VLSI design at the Caltech Computer Science
Department with 
Dr. Alain Martin. 

 A recent project with Uri
Cummings was an asynchronous digital filter.  Although we
misplaced a well plug on the first try, our second fabrication run is
back and IT WORKS! Here's more info:


 
Performance Summary
 
An Asynchronous Pipelined Lattice Structure Filter (Layout)
 
An Asynchronous Pipelined Lattice Structure Filter (Paper)
 My group is currently working on an asynchronous version of a MIPS
R3000 processor.  Uri and I are currently working on the "Vortex".
You'll hear about both of these real soon now.


Minimal Surfaces
 One day I got bored and rewrote a high school science project of
mine.  It approximately solves for minimal area surfaces on parametric
boundary curves.  This is the same shape you get with soap films on
a wire frame.  Here are some nifty pictures:

 Helicoid
 Catenoid
 Moebius strip
 Linked rings
 Wavy ring
 Very wavy ring

CS284
 The only reason I finally have a Web page is to turn in my CS284
homework.  Here are the first two assignments:

 Modified DrawSmooth

Here is the final project, a solution of quantum ground states using
cubic bspline basis functions:

 Psi
