<!-- This is a comment >
Rajesh Talpade is a PhD student in the 
 College of Computing, at
the  Georgia Institute of
Technology. He is a member of the 
Telecommunications/
Networking Research Group. Rajesh's current research 
interests include 
multicasting, communication protocols, multimedia and distributed computer 
systems (postscript  resume).


Rajesh received a B.E in Electronics Engineering from the
University of Bombay, India, in 1990.  He was awarded an MS in Computer 
science by the University of South Carolina in Fall, 1992. Not having had
enough of graduate school, he joined Georgia Tech in Winter, 1993, where he is 
currently pursuing a PhD in CS with emphasis on Networking. The highlight 
of his stay in Atlanta to date has been his getting married to Deepa. He is
currently working on aspects of IP-multicast over ATM, in 
collaboration with Bellcore, Morristown, NJ.
