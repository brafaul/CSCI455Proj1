Research Interests
 
I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science working with
Margo Seltzer.  We are working on the problem of searching large
facial image databases in the case where a user begins the search with
only a mental image of a sought-after face (e.g., the classic mug-shot
search problem).  We are looking into using representations (such as
eigenfaces) that have been applied successfully to database searching
in face-recognition tasks and incorporating them into face-creation
systems, so that a user can both create faces and search for them in a
database.
 
In previous work, we built the Drawing Evolver, which
enables a user to create drawings (including drawings of faces) with
an interactive genetic algorithm.  For a poster presentation about 
the Drawing Evolver click  here.  
 
A research paper on the Drawing Evolver can be accessed by clicking
