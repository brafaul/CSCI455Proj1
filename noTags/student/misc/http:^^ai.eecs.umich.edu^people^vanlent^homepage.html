Welcome to Michael van Lent's Homepage

I am a PhD student and research assistant at the University of
Michigan in the Department of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  I work in the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory which is housed in the Advanced Technology Lab.  I have
available (in postscript) the faint beginnings of a Curriculum Vita.

Research Interests

Changing Representation to Improve Planning Efficiency
I'm currently in the final (I hope) stages of developing a
dissertation topic which I have to propose to a committee by May 1996.
See here for a description of what I've done so far and my
bibliography.

Very old info on my Dissertation Topic
The Soar architecture


Planning in complex domains
An independent research project on how to integrate planning and
immediate reaction in a tactical
air-to-air combat domain.

Tag-Soar
Tag-Soar is a game (along the lines of CoreWars or Bolo) in which
you program agents (called Taggles) to battle each other in a maze
like environment.  


Game Theory and Machine Game Playing
My Master's Thesis (from the University
of Tennessee, Knoxville) was titled A Pruning Algorithm for One
Player Games with Hidden Information.

Genetic Algorithms
My first interest in the field of artificial intelligence was
genetic algorithms.
