Research Activities


  I am interested in making distributed computing accessible to
  common programmers.

  
  I have co-authored the design, and implemented a programming
  environment for workstation clusters.  It is unique in that it
  separates the programming model from the execution environment:
  programs are written for a shared memory multiprocessor; and
  applications execute on a network of dynamically changing
  workstations.  The load balancing, fault masking, and data coherence
  are provided transparently by the system.  The working prototype has
  demonstrated impressive performance results on a network of
  workstations with fluctuating work-loads, network traffic, and
  failures.

  
  For more information see the expanded
  version of my research activities, or visit the official
  Calypso
  home page.
