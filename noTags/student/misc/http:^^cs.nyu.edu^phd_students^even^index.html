Research
Interests


Right now, I am working on a simulator for complex adaptive systems.  In its
current incarnation it simulates a simple market.  Since it is
implemented in Java, I have the alpha version
on-line.

My longer range goal is the application of market ideas to
the design and analysis of systems in several areas of computer
science including intelligent agents, distributed 
systems, and networks.  For example, I plan to use my simulator to
explore credit based control strategies for ATMs.
