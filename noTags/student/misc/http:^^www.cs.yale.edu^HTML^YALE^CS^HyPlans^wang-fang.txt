Fang  Wang


Welcome to my home page!
As you can see,  this site is under construction. 

 Research work 
I am a PhD student in the Programming Languages and Systems group at the

 Computer
Science Dept of 
Yale University. 

My research interests include algorithm design and system implementation 
for multiprocessor distributed and network systems.  If you are interested in my work, here are some 
representative papers. 



During my recent summer vacations I interned  at  IBM T.J. Watson Research Center where I enjoyed the beautiful sunset. It is also possible to have bear encounters at
nearby Bear Mountain park and Catskill mountain range further north.
