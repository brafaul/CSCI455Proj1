Research interests 
My research focuses on computer models of similarity and analogy, both
as practical modules within AI systems and as cognitive models of observed
psychological effects. I am especially interested in how we use one area
of similarity--symmetry and regularity detection--to break up the world
into comprehensible parts. 
I mainly work with my advisor, Ken
Forbus, and the Qualitative Reasoning
Group at the Institute for the Learning
Sciences. However, I also spend a lot of time with psychology
researchers in Dedre
Gentner's lab.
