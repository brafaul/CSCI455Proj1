Wheeler Ruml
  Greetings!


 Office Address: 
  Aiken Computation Lab, Room 220   
  Harvard University  
  33 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 
  (617) 495-9516 (shared),  (617) 496-1066 (fax) 
ruml@eecs.harvard.edu
 Home Address: 
118d Holden Green, Cambridge, MA 02138 
(617) 441-7947 (between 8am and 9pm, please)


 My interests include (but are not limited to): 

 Representations of Meaning (in computers, people, and linguistic theory)
 Cognitive Modeling (in neurons, mobots, and more abstractly - some 
links)
 Alternative Search Spaces for Hard Problems
 The Fine Arts (especially cooking and urban design)
 Sculling (back when I had the use of my hands)


I'm always on the lookout for more information about courses, talks,
or papers at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognitive
psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience.


 Current Projects 

Current instantiations of my interests for which there are observable
consequences that you might be interested in.

 Graph Bisection  With Stuart
Shieber and Joe
Marks, I've been working on search-based optimization algorithms
for the NP-complete problem of graph bisection.  My aim is to evaluate
methods based on indirect search, in which the representation modified
by the search operators is decoded by a heuristic into a problem
solution.

 A Model of Lexical Access  With Alfonso
Caramazza in the Psych
Dept, I am building a computational model of a theory of lexical
access.  This attempts to explain how one's intended words are
expressed in sounds, while accounting for speech errors, naming
experiments, and patterns of impairment in brain-damaged subjects.

Computer
Science 182 I am a teaching fellow again for CS 182
(Intelligent Machines: Reasoning, Actions, and Plans) during the fall
term 1996.  If you have questions or comments about the course, please
let me know!



 Publications 

Before I turned to graph bisection, I did some work on number partitioning:


 Wheeler Ruml, J. Thomas Ngo, Joe Marks, and Stuart Shieber,
Easily Searched Encodings for Number Partitioning,  Journal of
Optimization Theory and Applications, vol 89, number 2, 1996.  Also
available as Harvard CS Technical Report TR-10-94r
(469k). 
 Wheeler Ruml, Stochastic Approximation Algorithms for
Number Partitioning, my undergraduate thesis and Harvard CS
Technical Report TR-17-93
(452k).


 Some Other WWW Sites 

A few basics:


 Harvard Computer Science
on-line Technical
Reports.

 
	Unified CS Technical Report Index at Indiana.

 
CMU AI Repository
  Internet AI Resources
 
Hypertext Map  showing Aiken and the Law School

 The 
MetaCrawler from Washington

 Altavista from DEC


For a more comprehensive list of useful sites, look at an old copy of 
my Netscape bookmarks.

 

If you think you know something that I should know, but that I might
not, please tell it to me! 

Thanks, 

Wheeler
