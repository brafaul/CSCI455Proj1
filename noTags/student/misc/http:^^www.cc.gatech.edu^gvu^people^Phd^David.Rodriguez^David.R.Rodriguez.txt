Information:
I am a Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology's
College of Computing.  I graduated in 1991 from Eckerd College with a BS in 
Computer Science.  I also graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology
with a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering in 1991.  I received my Masters of 
Science in Electrical Engineering in the fall of 1992.  I was also married that
quarter.  I am currently in the Ph.D. program and working at the Georgia Tech
Research Institute.
I am also active at the GVU Center 
at Georgia Tech.  
I have been working with two Professors:

Jessica Hodgins
Larry Hodges

Research areas:
I have worked on a
 3D dynamic simulation of a bicycle rider
, with Professor Hodgins.


I am also working on animation techniques in virtual environments with 
Professor Hodges.
 I have extending the current Simple Virtual Environments (SVE) 
virtual environment toolkit to include simple prescribed and dynamic motions
for virtual objects.  I have used my animation system to develop a virtual 
reality game. Here is the opening screen for the game:


My favorite hobby is collecting comic books.  Here is a link to 

the best comic shop in Atlanta.

 Here is Kipp Jones helping me get this page together:
