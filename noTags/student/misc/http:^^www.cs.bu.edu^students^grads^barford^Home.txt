This page is under construction (so what else is new?)

I have a bunch of things that will be added to this page in the near
future including important information on my research, photos, my personal 
history (by popular demand - it was lived better than it will read), links 
to all of the sites on the Web that I am interested in, etc.  Now all I
need is the time to do it!

Currently, I am toiling away in coursework trying to get some research done
at the same time.  Some (most) of my current research interests are being
discussed in a BU Brown Bag Lunch Presentation.  I'll get the page link set
up soon.  Generally I am looking a questions in distributed systems and
specifically I am addressing the extension of some of the work that my
advisor Mark Crovella is doing in self similar Web traffic characterization.

I am also part of the OCEANS group here at BU (check out the Web page).
This group is doing some really interesting work and will be doing a lot
more in the future.
