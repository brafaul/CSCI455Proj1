George Rouskas is a PhD student in the 
 College of Computing, at
the  Georgia Institute of
Technology.

 He is a member of the Telecommunications/Networking Research Group.
George's research interests include lightwave and high-speed networks,
distributed computing systems, multicasting, and performance evaluation.



George received the 5-year Diploma in Electrical Engineering from the
National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 1989. He then
joined the
 College of Computing 
(at the time, School of Information and Computer Science -- was it that
long ago?) at the 

Georgia Institute of Technology , to 
pursue a PhD. He was awarded a M.S. in Information and Computer Science
in March of 1991. George hopes to graduate in June of 1994, and will
join the faculty of the Computer Science Department at North Carolina
Stae University in August of 1994.
