Master's Degree Candidate, Computer Science
Georgia Institute
of Technology
I earned a Master's Degree in Computer Science at
the College of Computing.
I finished in December, 1995.
During the summer of 1995, I took Software Generation, Testing,
 and Maintenance (CS8113A).  We had a team project to expand the
CITATION program and include a
Web interface.
The previous summer (1994) I took Human-Computer
Interface, CS6751.  I worked on a fun project designing an
information kiosk for an art museum.
My undergraduate degree is in biochemistry/molecular biology,
and I earned it at Harvey
Mudd College in 1981.  I got a
Certificate in Computer Science at UCLA
in 1991; that's equivalent to taking the undergraduate CS major classes.


Obviously, if you're reading this, you are either actually interested in
me, happen to think that anything on the World Wide Web is important,
or are hopelessly bored.  In any case, you might want to seek out
psychiatric help.  There are cheaper alternatives, though.  To satisfy
your strange curiosities, you can check out
what I do with much of the rest of my time,  or
find out more about my life (if you don't have one of
your own).  If you wound up viewing this page by mistake, you can
get an overview of all of my stuff.
