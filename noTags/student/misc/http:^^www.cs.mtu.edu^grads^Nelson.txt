Final Exam - Review topics...


Chapt 1: Pointers

Pointers ( operators *, &, ->, NULL )
Arrays ( implementation as pointers, and the [] operator )
Character Strings - arrays of characters ( NULL terminator )
Structures ( almost same as classes )

Chapt 2: Classes

Constructors, Destructors, Copy constructors & the defaults
Operator overloading - istream, ostream, friends, 'this' pointer

Chapt 3: Templates

Global template functions
Template Classes
Instantiation, and binding

Chapt 4: Inheritance

Public vs. Private
HAS-A relationship, also composition
Public, Private, and Protected member status
Multiple Inheritance
Constructors, Destructors, Copy constructors, and operators in inheritance

Chapt 5: Algorithm Analysis

What is algorithm analysis?
Big Oh notation
Now the commen big Oh classes, i.e. linear, logarithmic, cubic, et cetera

Chapt 6: Data Structures


Know the appropriate operations, and their order, for the following Data Structures:

Stacks
Queues
Priority Queues
Linked Lists
Binary Trees ( and general trees )
Hash Tables

Chapt 7: Recursion


Two Rules:

1 - Have a BASE CASE, solvable w/out recursion
2 - Make progress towards the base case ( beware of cicular logic )


NOTE: This is a rough list of review topics.  I may have forgotten some topics so it's a good idea to check the syllabus and review the text.
