Welcome to Leonid Zheleznyak's home page.





Happy New 5757!!!


I am a Ph.D. student at the 
Computer Science Department  at
Courant Institute of Mathematical
Sciences of New York University.

I receieve MacCracken Fellowship from New York University.

I am interested in Distributed Systems. My advisor is Professor 
 Zvi Kedem . 
I participate in the 

Calipso project.




I receieved my B.S. (Summa Cum Laude) in
Computer Science and 
Applied Math and Statistics
from the 
University at Stony Brook in 1996. 

I received NSF

Honorable Mention of 1996 in Computer Science.

Studying at Stony Brook I worked for the Affirmative Action Office
that deals with the Affirmative Action policies and sexual harrasment on campus.
In the Fall of 1996, I worked as Student Assistant at an Instructional Computing Lab helping
students use multiuser systems. Then I worked on a 
 Lilco (Long Island Lighting
COmpany)  project at
 Harriman School for
 Management and Policy.


Summer of 1995, I had an internship at the 
Computer Associates International, Inc. 
I worked on CA-Unicenter/UNIX - an enterprise management software.
I really liked the work more than the money they paid.


Before coming to America in 1993, I lived in 
Mos
cow, 
Russia.

I graduated from Moscow State High School #57, which is famous for its
mathematical program. 

Then I spent 3 years studying
