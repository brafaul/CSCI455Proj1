Bobby� Krupczak


Bobby� Krupczak is a PhD student in the 
College of Computing, at
theGeorgia Institute
of Technology.

He is a member of the Telecommunications/Networking Group.
Bobby�'s research interests include network
protocols, protocol environments, operating systems, distributed
computing, and network management.  The 
Protocol Playground has more information on his current work.


Bobby� received a B.S.C.S in Engineering from the
University of Florida along time ago.  After working for a 3 letter
computer company that got bought by a 3 letter long-distance company
(and then sold again) (and getting married to a fabulous babe), Bobby�
returned to pursue PhD studies, here at the College of Computing.  He
was awarded a M.S. in Computer Science in June of 1993.  He is
currently pursing a PhD and had hoped to be out of here by the Olympics
but that (obviously) didn't happen.  Bobby� does
not like to be called 'Robert', 'Bob�', 'Rob', or 'Robby'.  He
simply prefers Bobby�.
