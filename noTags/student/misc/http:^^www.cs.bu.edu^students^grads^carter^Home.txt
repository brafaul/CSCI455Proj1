Currently toiling away at the  Computer Science
Department,

College of Liberal Arts,  Boston University,
and getting a degree ??? Long ago I went to  RPI
 in 
 Troy, NY

Teaching

 Spring 1996: 
 cs210: Computer Systems  
  Previously:   Taught CS 113 and EK 121. Have been a teaching
fellow for  
CS/EK 420, CS 512, and CS 551.




Research
Current
Since the Fall of 1995 I have been a member of the
OCEANS research
group.  Prof. Crovella and I have been  studying  tools and techniques for the 
measurement of available bandwidth in  packet-switched networks. Our
publications in this area can be found
here
Previous
During 1993 and 1994, I worked on  Genetic Algorithms for Combinatorial
Optimization with 
 Kihong Park . Here are our related papers:    

 
       On the effectiveness of genetic search in combinatorial optimization 
	(BU-CS-TR 94-010) (868k) 	Presented at  10th ACM Symposium on Applied
Computing, Genetic 	Algorithms and Optimization Track,  February 1995.   

 Scalability problems of genetic search. 	In  IEEE International
Conference on Systems, Man and  	Cybernetics,  October 1994.    
 
       How good are genetic algorithms at finding large cliques  	(BU-CS-TR
93-015) (211k)     



Hobbies?  (yea, right)
Lately, I've been spending some time on lake Winnipesaukee, in
Meredith, NH. Check out
the latest temperature
readings in the lake.
In my copious free time I like to 
  Juggle  and ride my bike.
In the summer of 1994, I got really ambitious and did my first loaded
bicycle tour. I went on  Bikecentennial's Glacier-Waterton Loop in beautiful
downtown Montana. We climbed Logan Pass, went on to Waterton Park in Canada and
back to Whitefish. For picture click
