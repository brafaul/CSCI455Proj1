I am a graduate student at 
 Yale's
 Computer Science department.
My dissertation on a parallel extension to Haskell is currently under
preparation. Meanwhile here are some recent papers:



Rajiv Mirani and Paul Hudak.
First-class schedules and virtual maps.
To appear in FPCA '95, June 1995. (Temporarily unavailable.)

Among other things I am interested in:



 High end audio.


 Pink Floyd.
Here's a great database of their  live recordings.


 Cricket.

 Sydney Cricket Ground's

 Formula One racing and exotic cars. Take a look at my 
 road car image archive.
