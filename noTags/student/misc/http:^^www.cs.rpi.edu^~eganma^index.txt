Mary Anne Egan



Hello and welcome to my home page.  Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.  I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y.

My area of research is ellipse characterization in microscopic images with applications to Materials Science.  This is a joint venture between the Computer Science department and  Materials Science and Engineering department.  

I am a teaching assistant for Operating System Fundamentals with Moorthy for the Fall 1996 semester.
