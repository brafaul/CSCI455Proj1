Thank you for visiting my page. It is not too much informative, but I'm
trying hard to enhance it.

 

Well, I'm trying to finish my Ph.D. Thesis under supervision of my
advisor Prof. Azer Bestavros. My
research project is related to the 
OCEANS .



I was born and raised in 
 Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. I attented  IME 
where I graduated in Electronics Engineering. In the same institution I
received my M.Sc. in Systems Engineering.

 

Before coming to the  Computer Science
Department at  Boston University 
with a scholarship  Brazilian CNPq , I
was working at  Embratel , from
where I'm in a leave of absence without pay.



My research interests include (but not restricted to) Distributed
Systems, File Systems, and in particular the 
WEB.
