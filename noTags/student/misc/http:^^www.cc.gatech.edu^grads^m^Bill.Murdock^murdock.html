Hello, all! I'm Bill Murdock. Since fall of 1994 I have been studiying


AI 

(part of an interdisciplinary 


Cognitive Science 

program) at the 


College of Computing, 


Georgia Institute of Technology.

My advisor is Professor


Ashok Goel

and I am a member of his


Intelligence and Design group.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in the spring of 1994 from 

Rice University

where I was at


Wiess College.  I received my master's degree in the spring of
1996 from 


Georgia Institute of Technology. 

My research focuses on areas relating to reflection, specifically on
using high level functional models of a system's reasoning to perform
self-modification. In particular I have been working on a project
called SIRRINE which uses models of this sort for self-redesign in the
context of multi-agent environments such as meeting scheduling.  The
overall paradigm that SIRRINE operates under describes learning as a
kind of design task; a reasoner is viewed as an abstract device and
the learning process involves redesign of the device. 

During the summer of 1996 I am working at the 


National Institute of Standards and Technology

within the


Engineering Design Technolgies group run by

 Ram
D. Sriram.  In particular I have been working on the Design Case
Study Framework, a long term research project with the objective of
providing a large scale database of human readable artifact design
cases for the support of engineering design.  My particular
contribution has centered around the issue of knowledge representation
within this project, particularly with regards to modeling the
functions of devices and their subsystems. 


I have also worked as a Graduate Research Assistant on the HIPED
project

which involves intelligent integration of heterogeneous data sources
in the context of design of physical devices and is part of the


Intelligent Integration of Information Technology

project within

the United States


Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

In this project, my work centers around Interactive Kritik, an AI
design system which currently acts as the intelligent agent at the
core of the HIPED system.  Additionally I am conducting research on
the topic of reflection, specifically on using high level functional
models of a system's reasoning to perform self-modification.





My most interesting HTML work is my 

Interactive Micro-Kritik project, still under developement.

Additionally I also did a reasonably pretty HTML


homework assignment for my HCI class in which I discuss natural
language interfaces.
