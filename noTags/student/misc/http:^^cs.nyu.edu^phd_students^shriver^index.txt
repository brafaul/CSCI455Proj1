Brief biography

I grew up in Lafayette, LA.  (It's a great place to raise 
kids.)  I received my B.S. in Computer Science and in
Mathematics at 
SUNY Stony Brook in 1987 and my
Masters in Computer Science at 
Brown University in 1990;
my Masters' advisor was 
Jeff Vitter.  
I am now pursuing a Ph.D.
in Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences
at NYU.

Dissertation

My advisors are
Alan Siegel  
and 
John Wilkes 
(HP Labs).  
Additional members of my committee are
Tom Cormen 
(Dartmouth College) and
Larry Carter (UCSD).
 

I am working on my dissertation 
on self-managing storage systems
as a visiting scholar at HP Labs with the 
Storage Systems Program,
under the direction of John Wilkes.  
This past summer, I modeled
devices and applications so that an assignment 
of applications to devices can be done in a reasonable amount of
time with minimum device cost.  This is an important part of
attribute-managed storage.  (See our MSIO 
paper
for more information.)


I am currently working on modeling realistic storage devices; one use
of such a model for attribute-managed storage. 
(My 
current unoffical thesis proposal.)
A more coherent view of my work is found in this one-page  
paper.
Self-managing storage systems, which is one possible
application of my work, is decided in an OSDI work-in-progress
paper.


I have designed a application programmer interface for 
multiprocessor multi-disk file systems.  (See the
 published papers section.)
