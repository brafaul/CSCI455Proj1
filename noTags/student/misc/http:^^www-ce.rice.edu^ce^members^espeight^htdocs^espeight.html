Computer Architecture Related Pages
The

World Wide Web Computer Architecture Page
at the University of Wisconsin.

The
FLASH
project is a shared memory multiprocessor,
a follow on to the DASH project.  The Flash home page also
has many architecture related pointers.

There is a table describing the performance of various machines at

netlib SPECmarks.
For integer uniprocessor performance, look at items labeled
"CINT92 Summary", and for floating point uniprocessor performance,
look at items labeled "CFP92 Summary".

The Computer Architecture Group at MIT has a home page,
CAG.  They have
some dataflow machine projects there, such as the J-machine, the
M-machine, and Alewife (arguably).  There is also some work
on FPGA's called Virtual Wires.

Carver Mead at Caltech has a group called the
Physics of Computation.
They are working on "making chips to emulate functions of the nervous
system, like retinas and cochleas".  There is a set of design tools
available there called the Chipmunk design tools.

The Data Diffusion Machine,
DDM,
at the University of Bristol is a virtual shared memory
multiprocessor.  The technique used goes by the acronym
COMA (Cache Only Memory Architecture).  Also their
home page has a pointer to a list of related research projects
which is great.

The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel project,
WWT,
is working on a new interface for
parallel computation called Tempest, which is being
implementing on a CM-5.
