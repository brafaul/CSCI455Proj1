 Retrieval of Passages for Information Reduction 

Information Retrieval (IR) typically retrieves entire documents in
response to a user's information need.  However, many times a user
would prefer to examine smaller portions of a document.  One example
of this is when building a frame-based representation of a text.  The
user would like to read all and only those portions of the text that
are about predefined important features.  

My research addresses the problem of automatically locating text
about these features, where the important features are those defined
for use by a case-based reasoning (CBR) system in the form of slots
and fillers.

We use a small set of ``annotations'', textual segments, that have
were saved when creating the original case-base to generate queries
and retrieve relevant passages.  Annotations are associated with the
slot about which they provide information.  Using a case-base of
annotations for each slot we generate and pose a query to an IR system
that is aimed at the retrieval of passages within a relevant document.
By locating passages for display to the user, we winnow a text down to
sets of several sentences, greatly reducing the time and effort
expended searching through each text for important features.


This research is done in conjunction with The Center for Intelligent
     Information Retrieval .
