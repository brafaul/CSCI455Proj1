Brief biography

I received my B.A with a double major in Computer Science and
Mathematics at New York University in 1992.  I am now pursuing a Ph.D.
in Computer Science at Courant Inistitute of Mathematical Sciences.

Here is a copy of my resume.

Visit my 
sister's homepage.

Research Interests

Information Filtering, User Interface, World Wide Web.

My advisor is Professor
Dennis
Shasha of CIMS NYU.  I am currently working on a tool to tailor
information flow for readers of complex documents.  I have a system
developed using the Motif development kit.  I also have a rudimentary
interface using the Pad++
widget for  TCL &
Tk.  One of the developers of this widget is Ben Bederson 

More recently, I have been playing around with  Java.  If you have a browser that
supports the Beta version of Java (e.g. Netscape v 2.0),
you check out my demo  Java Maze.
Very soon, Thinksheet will be accessible via the World Wide Web using
a Java interface.
