 CURRICULUM VITAE 
 Research Interests 
Theoretical and mathematical foundations as applied to AI, simulation, and
computational mathematics, including discrete mathematics, probability
theory, and formal languages; 
formal analysis techniques, design theories, and software engineering
methodologies for constructing sophisticated problem solvers
(especially artificial intelligence-based systems); 
multi-agent, distributed problem solving systems;
scheduling, planning, and OR optimization tools and algorithms;
application of abstractions and approximations in real-time AI and as
meta-level knowledge in sensor interpretation systems;
and languages and development tools for parallel and distributed
processing. 

I am currently applying my theoretical research results in further
research and development of enterprise management systems, concurrent
engineering systems, and simulation and analysis applications.
I have recently started a research project that is attempting to build the
world's first fully deployed "Virtual Enterprise."

 Friends and Family 

These are some interesting pictures that will eventually have clever
captions under them.



I'm the one on the right.  (On the right side of the picture, that
is.)  The other guy is someone I walked with in a parade once.  Long
story.  If you want to hear it, ask my wife.  She appears below.  She
used to be a charter sail boat captain in the Caribbean.
