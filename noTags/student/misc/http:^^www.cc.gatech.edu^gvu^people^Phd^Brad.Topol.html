I received my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science from
Emory University.  I came here to pursue a Ph.D. degree. I am 
interested in researching in the area of parallel systems and in the 
visualization of such systems.  Currently, I'm   
with the Software Visualization
Research Group, investigating parallel system design methodologies 
necessary to produce useful and accurate system visualizations.


Current Research:

 PVaniM 2.0
 PVaniM
 PGPVM
 Conch Visualization Package
