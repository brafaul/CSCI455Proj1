This site is a work-in-progress.  (Please stand by while I get myself past the "Web Page Novice" stage.)  In the meantime, you may amuse yourself with any of the following:

Take a peek at my NYU 
course work.
Check out my Java 
Snake Applet.
 I was featured in an article in the June 1996

ComputerWorld Client/Server Journal.
  The article starts on paragraph 4.
Check out some of my favorite websites.
