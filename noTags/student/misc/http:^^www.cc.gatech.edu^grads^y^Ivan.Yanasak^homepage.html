Historical Information

Ivan grew up in Dickinson, Texas (about 30 miles south of Houston).  He 
received his B.S. in Computer Engineering (concentrations in operating
systems and music composition) from Carnegie-Mellon in 1989, and his
M.S. in Information and Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 1991.
Ivan then worked in industry for a couple of years, and came back to 
Tech to start his PhD work in the Fall of 1993.

Research Interests

Ivan's general research interests are in computer architecture, operating
systems, parallel processing, and distributed systems.  He is currently 
involved with the Beehive DSM system design and development effort, with 
emphasis on applying shared memory optimization techniques to parallel
database processing.
