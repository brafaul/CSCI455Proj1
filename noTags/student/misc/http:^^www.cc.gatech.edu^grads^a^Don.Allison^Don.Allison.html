General Info
I am a graduate student in the College
of Computing here at the 
Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to coming to Tech, I spent 10 years
working for Hewlett-Packard's
 Test & Measurement Group, designing
firmware for their digital oscilloscope line. Taking advantage of one of
their downsizing packages, I came to Tech to study computer graphics and
AI. Currently I'm interested in animating autonomous agents and interacting
with them, and work with the 
Virtual Environments group and the 
animation group of the GVU Centre. 

Work



Click here
for my current work schedule as the GVU lab GRA, where I maintain our network
of PCs and Macs and assorted peripherals.  I also teach an occasional
Alias
 Studio
and 
Power Animator course for
OIT's
SciVis Lab.
Even when I'm not "officially" working, I'm generally in
the lab, so feel free to stop by and ask if you have any questions.

Research
Currently I'm working on the virtual
gorilla project. Prior to this I worked on building and interacting
with emotional
autonomous agents as part of the Dance Technology project in conjunction
with the Atlanta Ballet. Unfortunately, the choreographer thought they
were too cute, and cut them from the performance.

Miscellaneous
In my spare time (what little of it there is) I annoy my dog, Bozo.
I also periodically donate platelets through the local
chapter of the American Red Cross
and am even on the NMDP Registry.
(What can I say...I'm a sucker for the Nutter Butters they give you
after you've donated!)  I even tilt at windmills occasionally to help maintain
a uniformly high stress level.

I'm collecting input.
