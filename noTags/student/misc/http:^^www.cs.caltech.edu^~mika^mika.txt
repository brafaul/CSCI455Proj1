There isn't exactly a whole lot here right now.


I'm a graduate student at Caltech.. but you probably already know that.
There's a picture of me here.

I was born in Stockholm, Sweden on March 23, 1971, and I lived there
most of my life (so far!) I graduated from high school in the 
International Baccalaureate program at Kungsholmen's
Gymnasium in Stockholm in 1989. Subsequently, I spent a 
year at the University of Stockholm and a year in the Swedish
Army, and I graduated from M.I.T. 
with bachelor's degrees in
physics and electrical engineering in May, 1994. A dvi copy of my
senior thesis is here.

I am in the Asynchronous VLSI Group
here at Caltech, so 
my research interests are mainly in asynchronous VLSI, but I have
done some internet stuff and spend way too much time with 
IRC.
There is some server source code if you want it. Some of the things that are being contemplated for the
upcoming redesign can be found in 
a mailing list archive.

Here are some things I have done recently:

"Project Y"-an attempt to bring together WWW and group-oriented discussions on the Internet. Together with Eve Schooler
and Nathan Mates.
Caltech computer scientists develop vegetable computer.

A breakthrough in environmentally conscious computing. Read more about
vegetable computers here.
A paper I wrote for a class (EE185a) about
Contrast Enhancement Lithography used in VLSI fabrication.
Last year I was a TA for CS138,
taught by Mani Chandy.
Earlier this year, I spent an inordinate amount of time with the CS 
department's new Pentium lab computers running NetBSD. Here's a report about this work.
This academic year (1996-97) I am helping to teach the department's 
legendary digital VLSI design laboratory CS/EE181.

When I'm not playing around with a computer, I'm usually trying to
keep my car running.

If you haven't already checked out Alta Vista, press here now for a WWW service that's guaranteed to blow you away.
