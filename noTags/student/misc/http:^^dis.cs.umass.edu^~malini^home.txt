 Research
Automated Model Acquisition for Adaptive Perceptual Systems

For complex perceptual tasks that are characterized by non-stationarity,
recognition systems with adaptive signal processing front-ends have
been developed.  These systems rely on hand-crafted symbolic object
models, which constitutes a knowledge acquisition bottleneck.  We
propose an approach to automate object model acquisition that relies on the
detection of signal processing discrepancies and their resolution.  The
approach is applied to the task of acquiring acoustic-event models for
the Sound Understanding Testbed.
