This is a relatively skimpy "home page" - I hope to be enhancing it
shortly.


I am currently a graduate student in the
Computer Science department at NYU.


To see a little about my past life, please try my
biography.


You can now view pictures from
my wedding.


I recently (August 1996) received my first patent!  This is based upon
work that I did seven summers earlier.  You can view
an abstract of the patent
on-line.
