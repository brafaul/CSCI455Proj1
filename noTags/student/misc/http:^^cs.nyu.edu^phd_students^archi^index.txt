Brief biography 

 I grew up in 
Calcutta , a city in 
India . Calcutta is the capital of
West Bengal .
I received my B.Tech in Computer Science from the

Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur . I am now working towards
my Ph.D. in Computer Science at New York University.



Research Interests

  Among other things, I am interested in algebra. For the Spring 96
semester, I am doing an independent study with Chee Yap on topics in
algebraic geometry. 

  I am also doing some interesting work on computer vision with Davi Geiger.
