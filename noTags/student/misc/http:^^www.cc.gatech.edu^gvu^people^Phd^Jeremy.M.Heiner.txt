Greetings!












	      I'm currently at
	      SuperComputing'96
	      in Pittsburgh, showing off some posters and software for our
	      systems research group
		(HPPCEL).
	    


		Take a peek at Georgia Tech's exhibition booth at
		SuperComputing'96!


	      There are a few other people from Georgia Tech here at
	      the conference:
	      
		Bill Appelbe,
	      
		Charles Hardnett,
	      
		Mary Trauner,
	      
		Song Zou


	      And thanks go out to Beth Schroeder, who came to help
	      us get the booth set up.
