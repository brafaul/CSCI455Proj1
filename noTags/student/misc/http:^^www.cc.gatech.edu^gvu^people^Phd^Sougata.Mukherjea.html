 Sougata Mukherjea




Sougata Mukherjea finished his PhD from the

   Graphics, Visualization, and Usability Center

of the College of Computing
at the 
   Georgia Institute of Technology 
 in 1995.
His research advisor was 

Prof Jim Foley.

At present, he is working in the C&C
Research Lab of NEC.

 Research 
His research interests include Scientific, Software and Information
Visualization. His dissertation was concerned with developing
strategies for efficient visualization of the information space
of hypermedia systems. He developed a tool called the 

Navigational View Builder 

for letting the designer develop effective views of the
world-wide-web. 
Before this, he was involved in developing a visual debugger called

Lens
.
He was also part of the team that developed

Glyphmaker
.

 Cricket 
I am very interested in Cricket, the greatest game in the world.
Here is a picture of my favourite cricketer, Sourav Ganguly, from my home city 

Calcutta.




Now here is a picture of two of my other heros, Kapil Dev and Sachin Tendulkar.
.




Finally here is a picture of the Indian captain Azharuddin with the Hero Cup 
which my country
India
won in 1993.




For more information on cricket, you can look at the

CricInfo Cricket Database.
