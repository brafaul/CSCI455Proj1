The following is an excerpt from
Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?
by Lorrie Moore.


A woman happens upon a frog in the woods.
"Kiss me! Kiss me!" says the frog,
"and I'll turn into a handsome prince!"

The woman stares, entranced, but doesn't move.

"What's the matter?" asks the frog, growing impatient.
"Don't you want a handsome prince?"

"I'm sorry," says the woman, "but at this point in my life,
I'm more interested in a talking frog."

Education




I've got lots of degrees, but not enough to make a Ph.D. just yet.
I've got two undergraduate degrees, both from the 

University of Pennsylvania (1991).
One is a B.S. in Engineering from the

School of Engineering and Applied Science
(major: 
Computer Science)
(minor: 
Mathematics).
My advisor was

Val Breazu-Tannen (great guy);
if I remember correctly, we studied some properties of term
rewrite systems.  Related to this, I attended an international
summer school on logic and computing: 
Logic and Algebra of Specification 
(the blue series) in Marktoberdorf, Germany.
My second first degree is a B.S. in Economics from the

Wharton School of Business (major: Finance).





I've also got two Master's Degrees.  
The first is an M.Sc. in Computation from the

Computing Laboratory at Oxford University (1992).
(A very nice family by the name of Thouron gave me a
scholarship to study in England for a couple of years).
My advisor was

Lincoln Wallen.
We studied the proofs-as-programs paradigm in 
second-order natural deduction proofs and
polymorphic \lambda-calculus.
In addition, I attended an international summer school on
Language, Logic and Information in Colchester, England.





My second Master's Degree is an M.S. in

Computer Science from 

Cornell University (1995).
At Cornell, I worked with

Bob Constable  and

Dexter Kozen
on some stuff about intuitionistic propositional logic and alternating
polynomial time.  I was supported by the Office of Naval Research,
and they sent me to my third and last international summer school on
Logics of Programs in Chambery, France.





These days I'm attending NYU
(still working on my Ph.D).
I've changed my habitat, transferred schools, and (sort of) given up
logic for a while - I've upgraded to studying applications of
economics and finance to computer science with advisor

Bud Mishra and friend/officemate

Ron Even.  Such a radical change warrants rationalization,
but in fact these topics aren't too bad from the mathematical point of
view.  In addition, I'm teaching a course on the 
Fundamentals of Computer Science using C.



Teaching


Fall, 1996:
This semester I am an Instructor in the 
Department of Computer Science
at NYU where I am teaching
Fundamentals of Computer Science using C.
This is a course in computer programming concepts for students with
little or no programming experience.  The intent is to teach students
to write both clear and efficient C programs by emphasizing structued
programming principles.
1995-1996:
During the academic year 1995-1996, I tutored inner city kids at
Washington Irving High School in junior high and high school level
mathematics.  Most of these kids were bright, but they often had
difficulty in school because English was not their first language.
In the end, I taught these kids maths and they taught me Spanish.
Spring, 1995:
When I first moved to New York, I worked as a computer consultant.  In
particular, I trained business executives and managment consultants at
McKinsey Consulting, Inc. to use software packages such as Lotus Notes
and Microsoft Office.  My speciality was regression analysis and
mathematical modeling in Excel.  My direct employer was 
Spencer Analysis.


Sisters


I've got two younger sisters, named Carolyn and Michele.
Carolyn presently lives in Ithaca, New York
(fun for the whole family!), where she attends

Cornell Law School.  She also did her undergrad there,
and in the meantime she got an M.A. in English from
 Iowa State University
in Ames, Iowa, where she specialized in Cinema Studies.

Michele just graduated from 
Cornell where she was a communications major.  She is
now residing around the corner from me in NYC, 
where she is pursuing a career in public relations
and electronic journalism.  Her first on-line publication for 
NBC
is just a click away:

Jackie of all Trades.

Parents


My Dad (
Dr. Robert Greenwald)  is Chief of Rheumatology at Long Island Jewish Hospital, in New
Hyde Park, NY.  He is listed in New York Magazine's Best of New
York as one of the best doctors for rheumatoid arthritis,
osteoarthritis, and psoriatic arthritis.

My Dad is also Professor of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine and Adjunct Professor of Oral Biology at the Dental School,
SUNY Stony Brook.  He teaches rheumatology to young doctors and
students and also runs a research laboratory.  His research interests
deal with i) matrix metalloproteinases, which are enzymes such as
collagenase which destroy bones and joints; ii) non-antibiotic
properties of tetracyclines; iii) oxygen free radicals.  He is the
chairman of the conference to be held in October, 1998 sponsored by
the NY Academy of Sciences, entitled

Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinases: Therapeutic Applications.

Lastly, my Dad is active as a legal consultant to defense attorneys
for cases of alleged medical malpractice or personal injury in
rheumatology, internal medicine, and orthopedics.  He is also a
consultant to law firms representing the defendants in the breast
implant cases.

My Mom (Dr. Elaine Greenwald) is a school psychologist in the Kings
Park School District, Kings Park NY. She also has a private
practice in clinical psychology in Melville, NY. She specializes
in marital problems, substance abuse, anxiety, phobias, and
depression.



Grandpa
My Grandpa was a Flying Tiger.



Travel


Originally from the Island, I am now settled in the big city,
but I do find time for annual (sometimes biannual) excursions to
Europe, Asia, and even Australia.  Still haven't been to South America
or Africa, but I've got interest in pursuing any research topics that
might take me there.
