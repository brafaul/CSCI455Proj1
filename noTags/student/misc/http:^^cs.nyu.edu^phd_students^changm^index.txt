"All composed things are like a dream, a bubble, a drop of
dew, and a flash of lightening. That is how to meditate on them. That is
how to observe them.", from Diamond Sutra.


Vita
My home country is Taiwan.
I joined NYU in Fall of 1992 as a doctoral
student of its Computer Science Department.
I am currently working on my thesis project --- a divide-and-conquer reasoning
and planning system on the card-playing phase of Bridge. I had my undergraduate
study at the Department of Computer
Science and Information Engineering, National
Taiwan University from 1984 to 1988. After receiving my B.S., I did
a compulsory two-year military service, then I worked as a research assistant
at the Institute of Information
Science, Academic Sinica, from
1990-1992.

"The Buddha knows that all things are like a dream, a phantom,
a bubble, a flash of lightening, but he still lives his life normally.
He still eats and drinks. The only difference is that the Buddha lives
his life in the spirit of signlessness and non-attachment."
from The Diamond That Cuts Through Illusion, by THICH NHAT HANH.
