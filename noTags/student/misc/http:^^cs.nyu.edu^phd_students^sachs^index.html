I'm a full-time 6th year PhD Student in 
Computer Science
at the 
Courant Institute of
Mathematical Sciences, 
New York University. 
My support this year generously comes from the coffers of the
University via the Dean's Dissertation Fellowship. This fellowship is
intended to encourage late-year slackers like myself to finish my
dissertation. Which leads us to ...

My research interests

I am investigating reusable and extensible synchronization for concurrent
object-oriented languages. For more detail, click 
here.


My advisor is 
Benjamin Goldberg.


Some useful and/or pertinent Computer Science links: 

CS Tech report search


Object-Oriented Information Sources
A site close to my heart.

General Computer Science Resources
A meta index.

Type Theory Papers
Certainly, of less general interest. But pertinent to me.

Computer Science Bibliography Glimpse Server


University of Tokyo Yonezawa Lab WWW Server


University of Edinburgh LFCS Tech Reports



TA/RA duties



Summer 1996
I designed and implemented a GUI front end in 
Java for the
Cart3D
computational geometry system, working with 
Marsha Berger
and 
Michael
Aftosmis.

Fall 1996
No duties

Spring 1997

I'll be the TA for Computer Systems Organization II (V22.0202), taught by 
Benjamin Goldberg.
I'll be teaching the C language during recitations.





The flesh around the dusty skeleton of professionalism
If you're curious, you can see my reading list.

I'm a sometimes-professional
jazz pianist. My favorites
include Thelonious Monk, Herbie Hancock, Abdullah Ibrahim, and Randy Weston.

I really enjoy a good
brew. 

Another favorite escape of mine: 
film.

Odds 'n ends ('n links)

Futurist Programming Notes

The Surrealist Compliment Generator

Wall O' Shame

Consequences<!-- - an online magazine regarding the nature and
implication of environmental change. Of course, funded by NSF and
others, so don't expect unbiased>
