 Brief Biography I received my MS
in Computer Science at Bucharest
Polytechnic Institute in 1987.  After that, I worked at the
Research Institute for Computers in 
Bucharest until 1990, when I became
assistant lecturer at Bucharest Polytechnic Institute.


Current Work and Research

My advisor is Prof. Ben Goldberg.



 Garbage collection in concurrent and distributed systems
 Functional programming languages: semantics, static analysis, implementation
 Lambda Calculus
 Compiler optimizations: instruction scheduling, data flow analysis
 The 
                 Griffin prototyping language.
