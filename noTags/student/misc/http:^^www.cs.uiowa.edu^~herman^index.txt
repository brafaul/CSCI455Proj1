The image to the left is a photograph of a goldfinch, the 
official state bird of Iowa, visiting a birdfeeder
in my backyard. 

 I am teaching: 
Algorithms and Data Structures  and also a 
course called  Creative Programming using J  in
the fall of 1996.  I taught 
Computer Communications  and a
 Seminar on Distributed Computing 
in the spring of 1996.
 My primary research interest area is distributed
computing;  I'm currently working on some projects related
to 
Self-Stabilization.
