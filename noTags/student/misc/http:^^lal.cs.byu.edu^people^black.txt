Paul Black is studying at
Brigham Young University
where he is pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.  He began his Ph.D.
program at 
UC Berkeley, and
transferred to BYU in 1993.  His research interests are
formal verification of software and software engineering.


Black earned an MS in Computer Science at the 
University of Utah
in 1983 and a BS in Mathematics at 
Southern Utah State College (now
Southern Utah University) in 1973.  He
has 17 years industrial experience developing IC design and
verification tools, designing configuration management systems,
assuring software quality, and managing business data processing.  He
is a student member of the ACM and
the IEEE. 


He served a mission for the
LDS Church in
Brazil, 
and has visited 
Belgium, 
Canada, 
Finland,
Germany, 
Great Britain, and 
Mexico.
There's even a recent 
picture on-line.
He keeps favorite links in a
personal hotlist
which he updates occasionally.

Formal Methods

Other, Less Directed Links

I've put together some web sites and collections.  Here
are some I'm especially happy with and links to other miscellaneous
on-line stuff of mine.



The

Emily Dickinson home page including an

archive of a discussion list and links to over
370 of her poems on-line.


I led a group consisting of most of my OO class in building a hypertext

OSA Tutorial.  There are 

links to on-line quizes, but the quiz program is currently
(21Mar96) not working.


As an experiment in HTML graphics and interfaces, I designed some
pages to resemble

control panels on the Enterprise.


To help a professor, I put the

Language And Learning Across Curriculum Committee on line,
converting their
bibliography,
brochure,
etc. to HTML.


Learning HOL lessons.

Goal Directed Proof (#1),

Induction (#2),

The Assumption List (#4).
