Research Interests:

I have been the head programmer on 
I-Observe,
a collection of tools for discovering usability problems by analyzing and 
visualizing
detailed usage logs. The 
Usability
Engineering Program is a group interested in and responsible
for the development of I-Observe. Some time this quarter I will pass
this project to another lucky student while I look for a job.

I spent the summer of 1994 at 
Intel in 
Portland, Oregon using ideas from
CHIME
to build I-Observe for Windows. Since then most development work has
moved from the Unix/X environment to Windows '95.

Other group projects I have been involved with include:

 Automated layout of dialogue boxes for UIDE (tech report)
 Netvis Analyzer

Other Interests:

I am clearly an atypical grad student because I spend some time 
outside the lab.
