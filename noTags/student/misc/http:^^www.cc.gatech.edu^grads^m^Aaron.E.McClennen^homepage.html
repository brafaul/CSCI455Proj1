The Life and Times of Aaron McClennen
 
About Me
This is me. (Who else?) 

I am a masters student here atThe College of Computing at Georgia Tech. I expect to finish my degree in the spring of 1996. I received my BA in History from Oberlin College with a minor in Computer Science in 1992. After that I spent one and a half years working with Habitat for Humanity International with the Information Systems department. 

My resume in a postscript file. 

So how is the weather down here? Take a look.
