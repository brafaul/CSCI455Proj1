History
I was born on 20th February, 1975 in Palakkad, Kerala,
    India.  I lived in Bangalore for most of my life, and in Madras for 4
    years.  I went to the Frank Anthony Public School, Bangalore, where I
    studied for 14 years from 1978 to 1992.  I graduated from the Indian
    Institute of Technology, Madras, majoring in Computer Science and
    Engineering.  I am currently in the 1st year of the doctoral
    program in Computer Science at New York University. 


Other interests

      Jack of all trades, master of a few. I play badminton, basketball,
    bridge, chess, soccer, table tennis etc. Sometime in my formative
    years, I was an athlete. I read widely, on topics ranging from
    hopelessness to unsurmountable optimism. I prefer prose. I am supposed
    to be tone deaf( some say "plain deaf"), nevertheless, I
    appreciate music from old Hindi films.
