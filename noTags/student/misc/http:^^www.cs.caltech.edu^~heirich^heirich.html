Rogues Gallery: some places I have worked


 Research notes, and (interesting?) tidbits: 




Scalable photorealistic rendering.






Diffusion Algorithms


Presented at the 1996 

Center for Research on Parallel Computation

Annual Meeting






Multibody fluid dynamics (with O. Schreiber)





Topological Search


Recursive search
for fixed points of functions of two parameters
or one complex parameter.
Applications include nonconvex optimization,
roots of polynomials,
and geometric intersection.
Immune to roundoff.



Skeptical that topology has relevance to computer programs?
Check  this  out.





Nonlinear Scaling and Speedup


Some non-obvious sources in numerical calculations.
