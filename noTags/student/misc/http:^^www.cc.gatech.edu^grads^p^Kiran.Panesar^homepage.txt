  Kiran Panesar 

Hello, I am a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech, and my research area is 

Parallel Simulation . I am also interested in 
  Computer Architecture , and 
 Operating Systems .
For my thesis, I am interested in
performance and architectural issues for Time Warp simulations running
on shared memory multiprocessors. 


Outside of my research I am active in organizing Indian classical music 
concerts. Recent concerts were Pt. Shiv Kumar Sharma in April 94, and Reena
and Rajeeb Chakraborty in Oct 94. Outdoor activities like hiking and camping
attract me. I fix cars and like to cook.


I am graduating in Dec 96. Here is my 
resume  and a recommendation letter. I am looking for industry jobs.

Meet my wife,  Ritu

  Current Research:    Parallel and Distributed
Simulation


My research is shared memory optimizations for high performance Time
Warp: efficient message passing, buffer management, and fast
continuous GVT calculations for real time applications.
