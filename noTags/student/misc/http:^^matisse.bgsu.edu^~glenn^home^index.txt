NOW you've done it...



Home Page a la Tuff Guy






Welcome to Cris Glenn's Wondrous Home Page.  We here at the 
factory have toiled for countless hours in order to deliver to you a 
completely flawless, intriguing product.

We have, for your wonder and amazement, an intense
resume to browse, 
a picture of me spending quality time
with my girlfriend Amy, and 
other mindless diversions are on the way.  Until then, you must simply be 
content looking at the resume and drooling.  Not bad, really.

Any party animals out there?  Here is a connection to the
WFAL Sound System
, the DJ service owned by BGSU's WFAL 680 AM Radio station and operated by, 
yes, yours truly.  It's a big deal, believe me!


For those who are interested in quality, creative people, then check out the
resume
of my buddy and roommate, Michael Comstock
OR
check out my buddy Marc's home page, called the
Daily Hoser!!!



Here's a bunch of pictures I promised you, Jas!
