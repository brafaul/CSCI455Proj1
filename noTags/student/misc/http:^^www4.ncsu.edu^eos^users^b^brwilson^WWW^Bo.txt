About me: 
I'm a grad student at North Carolina State University. My area of interest is
Computational Science. My BS was in Physics and I am now in the masters program
in Computer Science. I enjoy almost all sports, unfortunately extreme psoriatic
arthritis has changed me from a participant to a spectator. I grew up in the 
mountains of North Carolina in a small town called Montreat. My family never
even had to lock our front door until just recently. Do places like that still
survive in our nation?  

Hobbies:

I enjoy writing 3D real-time computer graphic games.
I also enjoy Differential Geometry.
I LOVE good science fiction!
