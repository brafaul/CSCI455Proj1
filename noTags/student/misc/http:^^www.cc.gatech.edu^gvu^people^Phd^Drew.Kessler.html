Drew Kessler



Drew is a PhD Student at the GVU
center at Georgia Tech's
College of Computing.  His current research is in the area of Virtual
Environments, working with 
Dr. Larry F. Hodges.
Drew completed his undergraduate degree at the  University of Virginia , doing research in Virtual Reality and User Interfaces as part of the User Interface Group.


Current Research Activities:
  The Simple Virtual Environments programming library development
A set of programming tools for easily creating a Virtual Environments Application, or a 3D visualization for flat screens or 3D glasses.  Features a event callback mechanism to handle events and a hierarchical description of objects in the Virtual Environments or visualization.  An object can be a graphical object of lines, text, polygons, or textured polygons, or an object can be a light or a user's view or hand cursor.  SVE is the basis for many major VE research projects in the GVU center, as well as some other places.
  Multi-user Virtual Environments

 
 Currently exploring methods of allowing multiple users (or computer agents) to share the same virtual environment.  More to come...
  Whole hand input to Virtual Environments
We have examined device characteristics of the Cyberglove glove input device over a wide range of hand sizes to determine the capabilities of the device for hand input.  In particular, we are concerned with obtaining gesture and hand recognition guidelines and algorithms that are user (or hand) independent.
