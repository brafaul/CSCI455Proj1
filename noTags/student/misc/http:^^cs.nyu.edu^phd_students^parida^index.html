Current Activities

Currently, I am a PhD student at 
  
NYU. 
I am working in the area of Computer Vision with
 
Davi Geiger  
and 
 
Robert Hummel . 
We are working on low level vision tasks like feature detection.
This has resulted in a piece of software, 

Kona ,
that 

detects junctions,
like corners, T-, Y-, X-junctions in
images. We are currently using junctions to understand 

illusory contours.


I am also exploring the 
area of 

Computational Biology
with
 
Bud Mishra 
and
 
Davi Geiger  .
The department here has a collaborative effort
with chemists, anthropologists and  mathematicians that are closely
studying and working on problems motivated by the Human Genome
Project.


Earlier Work
Earlier, as a computer scientist at the 
 National Centre for Software Technology 
  
 (NCST), Bombay,
I was involved in a modest 

melange of  CAD related activities .
See
publications,
software developed,
technical reports
for details.

NCST offers graduate level diploma courses
and also advanced level courses on 
specialized topics for people in the industry:
I participated in a fair amount of 

teaching 
in both.
