Michael Donahoo (call me "Jeff") currently is a Ph.D. student studying  Networking
 in the College
of Computing at Georgia
Institute of Technology.  My networking research interests include
efficient multicast communication and accurate network modeling.  My
database research interests (from a former life)
include heterogeneous database and automated integration of 
distributed and autonomous data sources (structured and unstructured) on an
internetwork.  My advisor is  Dr. Ellen Zegura .


   My Daughter, Michaela Ashley Donahoo 
 I am also the coordinator for the College of Computing  Grad Tea
