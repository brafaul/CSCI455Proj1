... David Martin Jr. (right) and Steve Godfrey in June, 1995, in the Arboretum near
Minneapolis.

 
Background


Dave was born in Ames on Columbus Day (look it up!) 1965 in Ames,
Iowa, to parents Dave Sr. and Anne, and brother Hogan.





Dave was reared in Ames, and immediately after high school, moved
to Berkeley CA with his then-boyfriend
David Johnson, where they both lived until late
1986.
Dave M. enrolled at 

Iowa State University (ISU) in 1987 and graduated in May of 1993
with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in
German.  In addition, he spent
the 1988-1989 academic year near Stuttgart (Germany), studying and
working for Hewlett Packard GmbH under the auspices of the 
Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Parlimentarisches
Patenschaftsprogramm.


In September 1993, the Daves moved to Brookline, MA, and Dave M.
enrolled in an MA/PhD program in 
the small, 
theory-oriented department of Computer Science 
at
Boston University.  Daves M. and J.
parted amicably in 
early 1994.  


At Mike Friedman's 30th birthday party in September of 1994, Dave M. met his beloved
boyfriend  Steve Godfrey.   Dave and Steve now temporarily
occupy the rectory of  St. John the Evangelist
 (Episcopal), while the ministerial search proceeds.




Science and Technology

Dave is currently studying complexity theory under his advisor
 Steve Homer
at BU.  Dave spent the summer of 1994 visiting his other advisor
Jack Lutz.

Dave has been employed in the ISU
Computer Science Department and
Computation Center
as a researcher, user consultant, 
and 
Project Vincent
 system programmer.  His years in California were spent as a
programmer, and until recently Dave indeed thought of himself
primarily as a programmer. 

 He now pretends he's a scientist.

Here's a postscript version of
The Global Power of Additional Queries to
Random Oracles, co-written with 
Jack Lutz
and Ron Book,
as presented at the Symposium for Theoretical Aspects of Computer
Science (STACS '94) in Caen, France.



 Queer Stuff

Dave has been gay as long as he can remember, and thanks to the
efforts of gay adults in the 60s and 70s---and of course, love
and support from his family---he has never been thrown onto
the streets, been given 
shock therapy, or been assaulted by friends.  Dave considers
his sexuality to be an important but unremarkable part of his
character.  He's not a queer evangelist, but he does strongly believe
that it's pretty hard to hate fags when you know some.  Dave
therefore begs his gay brothers and lesbian sisters: 
Come out!


Here's a short blurb on 
Alan
Turing, the Father of Computer Science.
