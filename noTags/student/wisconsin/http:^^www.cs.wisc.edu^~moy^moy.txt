What's New
October 17, 1996. Now that I'm back in
Madison, I should update several of my pages.

Changed the background to black for better contrast.
Updated contact information.
Minor changes to various pages.

Here's a list of older updates.

I prefer to keep my main page brief, so here
are links to my second-level pages:

Navigational index
About me
Friends
Some favorite pages on
        the Web
