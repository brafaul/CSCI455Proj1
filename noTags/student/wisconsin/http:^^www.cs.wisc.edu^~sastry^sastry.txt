I am ...

S Subramanya Sastry( Here  is a mugshot of mine). 
I come from Hospet, a town in 
Karnataka ,  India . 
Did 12 years of my schooling there.  Near Hospet(10 kms away) is 

Hampi , the ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire.  Also, 5 kms away, is 
the Tungabhadra Dam, built across the Tungabhadra river.  These places are 
beautiful, but unfortunately I dont have photographs of these places or I 
would have scanned and put them in my  photo album.  

Not so long ago,


I was an undergraduate at the  

Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur ,
in the 

Department of Computer Science and Engineering.  Those 4 years 
were wonderful.  My  photo album  has a few
photographs from that time.  
Gokul  is also maintaining a 

photo album  which contains many photos of IITK.  The 

IITK Class of '95 homepage has information about my classmates
at IITK.

The present


Currently, I am a graduate student in the 
Computer Sciences Department  at the 
University of Wisconsin, Madison.   I plan to do a Ph.D. here.
Here are the  courses  that I have registered
for in Spring '96.


Interests


My academic interests lie in the fields of 
 Architecture,

Programming Languages and Compilers.
Hope to graduate some day with a Ph.D. in one of these fields.

Cricket is one of my favourite sports.  Used to play
phatta at IITK which is a tennis-ball version of cricket.  Not that
I was a champ or anything, but it provided a lot of entertainment
in the company of my friends.  

My bookmarks have a few links to some cricket sites.

I enjoy listening to music, anything that is pleasant to the ear.  I must 
say I dont consider hard rock or metal something really pleasant.  I do
not watch much TV, but of whatever I have watched, I liked Seinfeld's
show very much.

As far as reading goes, I am not a voracious reader.  Rather than say what
I like, I can better say what I do not like.  I do not like horror, fantasy,
neither do I like Science Fiction.  I have unsuccesfully tried to 
come to grips with these.  I like something which is down-to-earth,
if you know what I mean.  Something which has a hint of romance in it, if
possible.  Jeffrey Archer has been my favourite author to date.  I also 
liked Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice very much.  Talking of reading,
 Ramesh Mahadeven's
articles  make for some interesting reading.

I also like playing bridge.  Back at IIT, Kanpur, I picked up this wonderful
game in the company of my friends.  After a long time, I am back at it
again here.  I also like solving crosswords, the cryptic kind.  But, in
the past year, I have not devoted much time to this hobby of mine.
