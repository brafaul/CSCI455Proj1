What a chimera, then, is man! What a novelty, what a monster, what a chaos,
what a subject of contradiction, what a prodigy! A judge of all things, feeble
worm of the earth, depositary of the truth, cloaca of uncertainty and error, the
glory and the shame of the universe! 
 --Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)
