Research Summary

I am interested in the performance analysis of DBMS operations on
advanced tape and disk technology, including disk and tape arrays. I'm
currently studying how to buffer large datasets from tertiary storage
to disk and memory when such data are used for data exploration and
visualization (the DEVise
project). My advisor is Prof. Miron
Livny.



My recent work includes improving the performance of relational joins
of large volumes of disk and tape-resident data (see publication list
below), and applying a log-structured organization to tertiary storage
to solve problems associated with the diverse characteristics and
functional limitations of tertiary media. Our recent paper on data
visualization and exploration discusses data and metadata management
issues when large and complex data sets are involved.
