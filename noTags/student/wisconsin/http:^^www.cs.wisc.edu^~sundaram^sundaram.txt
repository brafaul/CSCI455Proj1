 (This is not me.) 
...where-upon he had the effrontery to push my hand severing the 
        patient's femoral artery. Blood spurted up and blinded the 
        anesthetist, who ran out through the halls screaming. Browbeck
        tried to knee me in the groin, and I managed to hamstring him with 
        my scalpel. He crawled about the floor stabbing at my feet and
        legs. Voilet, that's my baboon assistant --only woman I 
        ever cared a damn about-- really wigged. I climbed up on the table
        and poise myself to jump on Browbeck with both feet and stomp him 
        when the cops rushed in.
