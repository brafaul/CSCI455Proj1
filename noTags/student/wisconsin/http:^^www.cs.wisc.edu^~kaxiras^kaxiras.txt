 Research Interests and Summary
 Recent Publications



Research Interests:

 Shared-memory multiprocessing & Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI)
 Cache design
 Aspects of Parallelism in Processor-in-Memory (or Memory-in-Processor) architectures (Galileo)


Research Summary:

In 1994 I have introduced the GLOW Kiloprocessor Extensions to SCI (a.k.a. Hierarchical Extensions SCI) in collaboration
with Jim Goodman. I am now working to both examine in depth design options and develop the upcoming 1596.2 standard in
colaboration with Jim Goodman, David V. James and Stein Gjessing.
