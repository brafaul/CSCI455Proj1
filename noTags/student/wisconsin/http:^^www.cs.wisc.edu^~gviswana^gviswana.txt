 Thesis Research  
My thesis focuses on the design and implementation of data-parallel
languages. I have been involved in the design of C**, a data-parallel
language (based on C++) developed locally. I have implemented a C**
compiler targeting the CM-5, and am investigating how data-parallel
applications can be executed as efficiently as hand-coded parallel
programs.




Here's a

Here's a  list of my
