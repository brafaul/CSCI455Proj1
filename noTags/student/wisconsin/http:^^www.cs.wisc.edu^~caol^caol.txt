Welcome to Lei Cao's Home Page




About Me
  I am a first-year graduate student in the Computer Science Department here at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Originally from Shanghai, China, I studied at Shanghai Jiao Tong University before I came to the States. (Any SJTU alumni out there?) 
  Currently, I am a lab consultant for CS 302 and also TA for CS 736. Life is no longer as easy as last semester, just like the weather in Wisconsin. I am taking three classes and in the mean time doing a master project. Here is my current schedule.
