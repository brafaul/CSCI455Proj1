" Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to 
an asylum for the verbally insane.  In what language do people recite at
a play and play at a recital?  Ship by truck and send cargo by ship?  Have
noses that run and feet that smell?"
 -- Richard Lederer 

 " There are three possible parts to a date, of which at least two must be
offered: entertainment, food, and affection.  It is customary to begin
a series of dates with a great deal of entertainment, a moderate amount
of food, and the merest suggestion of affection.  As the amount of
affection increases, the entertainment can be reduced proportionately.
When the affection IS the entertainment, we no longer call it dating.
Under no circumstances can the food be omitted."

 -- Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behaviour
