	    Some blah about me
	  

	  My home country is
	  India. Though
	  I'm originally from the state of
	  Kerala,
	  I've stayed all my life in
	  Calcutta.
	  I studied at Don Bosco School, Calcutta
	  which is run by The Salesians of Don Bosco.
	  I did my undergrad at
	  IIT Kanpur with
	  my major in Computer Science & Engineering. I'm currently a first-year
	  graduate student supported by a teaching assistantship in the
	  Department of Computer Sciences at
	  the University of Wisconsin-Madison, staring
	  down the barrel of a Ph.D. in either
	  Computer Architecture or
	  Programming
	  Languages.



	    My interests
	  



Music : rock/metal/alternative/blues
	    
	      Movies, books and all that
	    
 CS stuff 
	      ( acads/hacking/industry and other geeky/nerdy stuff )
