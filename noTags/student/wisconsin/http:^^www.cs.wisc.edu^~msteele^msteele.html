Me sitting in the Univ. of Maryland CS department's computer lab,
struggling through my undergraduate operating systems class sometime
around April 1995.  Note the time stamp in the lower right corner says
"4:05".  That's AM folks...
I'm a graduate student in the 
Computer Sciences Department at the 
University of Wisconsin--Madison (School Motto: "Come and freeze
in the land of cheese").  My research and study interests center 
around artificial
intelligence, 
computer vision,
and operating systems (I hope to narrow it down some in the coming years). 

This semester, I am a graduate
instructor for 
Section 10 of CS 302 (Algebraic Language Programming).  

I received my 
Bachelor's Degree in May 1996 from the
University of Maryland's
Computer Science Department.

now has over 400 members world-wide.
If you're the predator and you're coming to kill me, I have some
infrared photos of myself so you'll know what I look
like.
