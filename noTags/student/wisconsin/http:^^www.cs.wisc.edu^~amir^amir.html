The ins and outs of my existence

I am graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  My new advisor, Guri Sohi, and I are looking into methods of alleviating data dependences in Multiscalar programs using the distributed register file.  Multiscalar programs are all that and a side of curly fries. 

I have a BS in Physics from Yale University and an advanced degree in nail design from Valley Beauty School.  Physics is interesting, but my beauty degree is much more practical. 

I live with my girlfriend Marci and our two cats, Joe and Charlie.  Marci also went to Yale, and now she is getting a masters in public policy from LaFollette Institute.  One day, she is going to be president.  In the meantime, she likes to solve linear regression problems, try out wacky recipes she finds in magazines and watch 'Party of Five'.

I like eggplant, which most people think is weird.

Anyway, I promised the ins and outs...

 In: Desi Relaford.   Out:  Terry Mulholland.

Areas of Rabid Interest

The love.  If you don't know what I am talking about, you better leave this page at once, never to return. 
Hmmm.  What AM I interested in?
