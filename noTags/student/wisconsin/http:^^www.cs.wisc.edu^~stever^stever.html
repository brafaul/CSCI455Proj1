 Steven K. Reinhardt 



I'm a graduate student in computer
architecture, working in the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel
group.  My advisor is David Wood,
although the other PIs of the WWT project,
Mark Hill and
Jim Larus, often feel free to tell me
what to do as well.




I'm planning on finishing this fall.  I will be joining the faculty of
the University of Michigan EECS department in January 1997.
