 My name is  S. Ashwin . I'm a graduate student in the 
Department of Computer Science at the 
University of Wisconsin, Madison. I come from
 India, and had
my undergraduate education at the  Indian
Institute of Technology, Bombay. The 
Department of CS at IITB is a fantastic place and worth visiting.

 If you'd like to contact me, you can
finger me
to find my whereabouts.
Alternatively, you can send email to me at  sashwin@cs.wisc.edu .
