 Research Interests

There is a growing need for exploratory analysis of very large datasets 
to discover useful patterns, and data mining is the new territory 
developed for this purpose. 
I am very interested in designing new efficient data mining algorithms or
tools for very large databases by integrating the techniques of 
databases, artificial intelligence and statistics. 


My Ph.D thesis topic is on clustering and density
analysis of very large datasets. That is, given a very large 
multi-dimensional dataset, and a limited amount of resources 
(e.g., running time and memory), design and implement algorithms 
to efficiently and accurately (1) identify the sparse and crowded regions 
(clustering analysis), (2) estimate the density function of the overall 
data distribution (density analysis). They are very important and practical 
branches of data mining, and can be applied to many domains such as, data
classification, image compression and pattern recognition.
