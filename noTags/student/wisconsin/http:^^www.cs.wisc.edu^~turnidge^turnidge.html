I am a graduate student in the 
Department of Computer Sciences
at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison.  I have been here for two years.  I am working with professor
Thomas Reps studying
programming languages.
I teach a section of cs302.
I hold a BS in Mathematics
and an MS in Computer
Science from Case Western Reserve
University, which is located in  Cleveland,
Ohio.
I am originally from Kent, Ohio.  My
family lives there.

They say you can judge a man by the company he keeps.  Click here for enough evidence to put me away for a long time.
Some amusements for you.
Some shortcuts for me.
