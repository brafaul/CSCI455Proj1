Award

Best Paper Award 9th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing, 
ACM Press, July, 1995. 


My research interest is in the area of 
programming languages and performance issues in parallel and
distributed systems.  
Recently, I have been studying techniques to detect and eliminate
performance bottlenecks in Distributed Shared-Memory Systems.
I have combined the 
 Paradyn Performance Tool
with Blizzard of the  Wisconsin
Wind Tunnel on both the Thinking Machine CM-5 and
the Cluster of Workstations (COW). 

 Recent Publications 
Fields of Interest

Performance Evaluation and Benchmarks 


Places where I have studied and worked:
 
High Performance Computing and Software Laboratory at 
the University of Texas at San Antonio,
where I have studied and published in the area of
parallel performance predictions, modeling and simulations. 
 Computer Sciences Department
at  Fudan University,
where I have participated in several National key projects of P.R. China,
in the area of software development environment, very high-level
programming languages, and object-oriented technologies, and
imcremental compilation techniques.
