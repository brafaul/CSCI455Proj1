Jon's Home Page


Welcome to Jon's Home Page!
I'm a first year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, 
studying computer science.  I am a TA for CS 132: Using Computers.  I 
am also maintaining a FAQ (Frequently 
Asked Questions) List on the latest PowerBook models released by Apple 
(the 5300's, the 190's, and the 2300's)


Here are a few things to look at:

Students in my CS 132 Lab Sections should 
click here
I've amassed a big list of good Web 
sites, in a number of catagories.
Check out the Web pages for the UW-Madison CS department, UW-Madison itself, and my alma mater, RPI!
The sites I visit the most often are:

Apple's Home Page -- For all your 
Mac needs
The Nando 
Times  -- For great news coverage
The Spot -- For mind-numbing, 
soap-operaish drivel
ZiffNet -- For computer industry 
news
CS564: Database Management Systems and  CS 701: Construction of Compilers -- 
For keeping up with my classwork
Today's 
Dilbert -- For a bit of a chuckle
