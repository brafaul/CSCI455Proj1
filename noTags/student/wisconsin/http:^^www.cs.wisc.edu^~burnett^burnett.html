My schedule for Spring 1996

Here are my stinkin' bookmarks.


SUNY-Albany Fall 1996:

I have the poor sod, the unfortunately named "***** ******" in my
class. A hypersensitive rockjock cretin who broods, glares, clenches
fist and cracks knuckle at "MR ******", or a tragically flighty
femme-man who has been getting razzed and asskicked since the third
grade -- or perhaps a smooth-skinned hardbody leatherboy who leers at
me whenever I call the roll? What difference does it make, since today
I giggled a bit when I said his name and in doing so became a
prostitute to society's bigotries -- my pedagody was my Isaac but the
black goat refused to stay his clawed hand. F**K!

SSSUUUHHH MMUUUHHHH DDDDUUUUUHHHHH MMMMUUUHHHH MAAAAHHHJAAAAAAHHHHH!
FFFUUUHHHHH YYYYYYYUUUUUHHHHH MMMMMUUUUUHHHHHMMMMUUUHHHHH!
UUUHHH UUUMMMM UUUHHHH WWWWWHHHHUUUUUHHHHH!



SUNY-Albany Fall 1995:

If I hit Mr. Zhang with my car, I wouldn't notice.
If I hit Mr. Eggleston with my car, I'd smile.
