Something to think about...

The Earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the Earth.
All things are connected, like the blood that unites us all.
Man did not weave the web of life, he is but a strand in it;
whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.

                                   -Chief Seattle


The man who sat on the ground in his tipi meditating on life and its
meaning, accepting the kinship of all creatures and acknowledging
unity with the universe of things, was infusing into his being the
true essence of civilization.

                                   -Luther Standing Bear,
                                    Oglala Sioux
