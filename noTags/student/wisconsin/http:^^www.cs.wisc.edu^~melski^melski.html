Michelle is an awesome person.  Her page is currently under construction.
My sister Kasey has a 
great home page, as does my brother Eric.


This semester I'm teaching a couple of sections of cs302.
I'm also working with Tom Reps in programming languages.  My
exact schedule still needs to be determined.

As an undergrad, I majored in Computer Science and Russian Studies
here at the University of Wisconsin.  I even spent the fall semester
of '92 in Russia.  I don't get a chance to use my Russian very often,
and I miss it a bit.  Someday, someday, I'll make it back.

My other interests include chess and soccer.  Recently, I've been
biking a bit, too.  I've also been distracted from work by numerous
books, and hasty rewrites of my web page.

Here are my 
.  I also want to put a link to
mapquest.  I plan on stealing a
lot of their maps in a second to give directions from Madison to Marshfield.
