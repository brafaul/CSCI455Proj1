NIKOS CHRISOCHOIDES 

 Nikos Chrisochoides 
 Ph.D.  Computer Sciences Department ,  Purdue University , 1992. 



Dr. Chrisochoides' work has touched many facets of parallel and distributed 
computing. His  work includes (i) research on parallel runtime support and back-end systems for parallel compilers and problem solving environments for 
multicomputers, (ii) parallel algorithms for scheduling, load balancing, 
and data distribution for adaptive computations. He co-designed and 
implemented many key software components of a well-known simulation 
environment,  Parallel ELLPACK .
