1979. Ms. Gohl has a B.A. from Vassar in Religion/Women's Studies and
a certificate of Ministry with emphasis on Peace and Justice from
Maryknoll School of Theology.  Her research interest is late
twentieth-century women and their spirituality within the organized
religious structures of mainstream Christianity.
