Hi there.  Sorry, every time they take a picture of me, I break the camera.  
It's too expensive to replace those cameras, so you'll just have to put up 
with the text.
You can always reach me at one of the following: 

ggjns @ mtsu.edu
root @ knuth.mtsu.edu
postmaster @ mtsu.edu


I'd like to hear from you if you have any questions or comments about the software, performance or accounts on MTSU systems.  Contact me at:

615-898-2129 (my desk)
615-898-2397 (Computer Science office number)
615-898-2144 (the Computer Science Lab number)
615-898-5567 (our FAX number)
615-252-5938 (my beeper number: wait briefly for 3 beeps, then enter the number you want me to see, press "#" and hang up)

Oh, you might also want to come by and see me.  I'm in  Kirksey Old Main (KOM)  room  351  over by the elevator.
