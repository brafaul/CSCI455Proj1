Projects:

Digial Vision Computer Eyes Video Capture Driver for FreeBSD (ISA card)
. This is a very old version of the Computer Eyes that supported data
transfers only through I/O ports and therefore was very, very, very slow.

Media Vision ProMovieStudio Video Capture Driver for FreeBSD (ISA card)
. In addition to the kernel driver, this package contains patches to the
MBONE conferencing tool "nv". The ProMovieStudio capture card is no longer
sold but is a popular card but should be available for purchase in the used
computer market.
Warning: I was unable to get the correct colors with the card I was using.

Matrox Meteor Video Capture Driver for FreeBSD (PCI card). 
In addition to the kernel driver, this package contains sample programs to do
single frame capture in every supported mode and patches to the MBONE
conferencing tools "nv" and "vic". The Matrox Meteor capture card is sold
directly from Matrox.
