Hobbies
I used to keep a pointer to my current bookmarks here, but the bookmark
file generated by my browser does not conform to HTML2.0, so I have decided
to remove it.




I would like everyone to be able to read my web pages without any bother
or annoyance, so I have made every effort to keep them compliant to HTML 2.0,
the current standard for the world-wide web.  If I were on my soapbox, I would
suggest that you do likewise.
