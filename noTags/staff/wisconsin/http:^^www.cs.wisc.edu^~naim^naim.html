 Bienvenido!
 I'm a new staff member working on the Paradyn Project. I just finished my
Ph.D. at the University of Southampton in England and I did my 
undergrad and MSc at the Universidad Simon Bolivar (Caracas, Venezuela).

 I was born in the beautiful city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. Barquisimeto
is located on the central-western part of Venezuela and has a population of
about 1 million people. Barquisimeto is also known as the 
musical capital of Venezuela. 

 My main research area is Performance Analysis and Visualization of 
Parallel Programs. However, apart from being a researcher, I like to play
classical guitar. In fact, I studied for a few years with two excellent
maestros: Rodrigo Riera and Antonio Lauro.

 I like to spend my time:

 Playing guitar 
 Reading good books (e.g. Sherlock Holmes stories) 
 Cooking
 Watching baseball
 And working too!! :-)

 If you like to see some beatiful pictures of Venezuela, please

 You can finger me at  
naim@cs.wisc.edu and check if I am around.

 Ah mundo Barquisimeto!
