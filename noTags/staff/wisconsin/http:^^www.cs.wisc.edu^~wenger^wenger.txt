Work
The main projects I'm working on are
COD (Clusters of Data providers) and
DEVise (Data Exploration and
Visualization).  Coming up with a good acronym is one of the most important
parts of a project, wouldn't you agree?

Here's a visualization
produced by the DEVise software.

The people I work for:

Yannis Ioannidis

    Miron Livny
Raghu Ramakrishnan
