Natural Language Processingand Information Retrieval

 

 Calvin:  "I like to verb words." 
 Hobbes:  "What?" 
 Calvin:  "I take nouns and adjectives and use them as verbs. Remember when `access' was a thing? Now it's something you  do . It got verbed." 
 Calvin:  "Verbing weirds language." 
 Hobbes:  "Maybe we can eventually make language a complete impediment to understanding." 

  
- Calvin & Hobbes, by Bill Watterson 

 Current Research Projects 
   Information Extraction  
 Our natural language processing research focuses on
 information extraction , which involves recognizing and
extracting specific types of information from text. We are currently
building a new conceptual sentence analyzer called Sundance (Sentence
UNDerstanding ANd Concept Extraction).   

   Automated Dictionary Construction  
 We have developed the AutoSlog dictionary construction system
that generates dictionaries of extraction patterns automatically using
an annotated corpus. We are currently working with a new version,
AutoSlog-TS, that does  not  require text annotations but
simply preclassified texts instead.  
  
   Text Categorization  
 Our approach to text classification an underlying information
extraction system to recognize linguisic context in order to achieve
high precision. We have developed several algorithms for
text classification, including the relevancy signatures algorithm, the
augmented relevency signatures algorithm, and a case-based
classification algorithm. 

   Information Retrieval  
 The URSA (Utah Retrieval System Architecture) Project has been
ongoing at Utah for many years and involves building query-based retrieval
engines and text browsers.
