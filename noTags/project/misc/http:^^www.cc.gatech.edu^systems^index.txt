 Motivation 

Parallel and distributed machines have become the premiere computational
engines for both business and research endeavors, and their use is
permeating into many other disciplines. In addition, new ways of interacting
with computers have evolved, enabling higher levels of interaction among end
users as well as enhanced interactivity between end users and their programs
than previously possible. As a result of these developments, large-scale
applications routinely use multiple distributed and prallel machines
connected by high performance communcation media. 

The architectural environment for facilitating the construction and use of
interactive distributed and parallel applications is multigranular --
consisting of fine-grain SIMD machines, medium-grain MIMD machines, and
coarse-grain mulitcomputers comprised of a farm of high-peformance
workstations, all of which are interconnected via high speed networks. While
such hardware and some of the software components are readily available,
what is lacking is the technology for easily assembling them to form
complete applications that are efficient, flexible, and highly usable for
non-computer scientists. The development of such technology is a fundamental
challenge for systems researchers.

The systems group in the College of Computing addresses this challenge in an
application-conscious way. The research projects currently being investigated 
cross the boundaries of architecture, operating systems, compilers and
programming languages, and usability:

 architectural mechanisms for scalable parallel systems, scalability 
studies of parallel and distributed systems, system abstractions for 
representing shared state in distributed systems, availability and 
fault-tolerance issues in distributed systems, operating mechanisms for 
high-performance parallel and real-time systems, peformance monitoring tools 
for parallel and distributed systems, and system mechanisms for parallel and 
distributed discrete event simulations.

 Current Projects:

HPPCEL - High Performance Parallel Computing and Experimentation Lab
