The Software Engineering Research Group in the Department of
Computer Science at Michigan State University performs research in the
area of formal methods for systems development.  There are two major
components making up SERG. First, there are a group of projects whose
objective is to develop techniques and tools that support the use of
formal methods in the different phases of software development.
Second, there are a group of projects that involve the use of formal
approaches to multimedia, embedded systems, hardware, parallel
processing, networking, distributed systems, and visualization.
