Natural Language Laboratory: Table of Contents


Natural Language Laboratory at Simon Fraser University  
Next:  What's New
Up:  Artificial Intelligence Research at SFU

 IRIS-2: Intelligent Interfaces for Information Access (coming soon) 

The natural language laboratory at Simon Fraser University is one of the 
larger North American labs working on natural language processing (NLP).  
An outline of natural language, the laboratory's theoretical and applied work 
in NLP, and the laboratory's infrastructure is given below.  These pages are 
still under development; comments on them are welcome.
