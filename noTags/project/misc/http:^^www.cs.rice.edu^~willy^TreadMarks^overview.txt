The TreadMarks Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) System


The TreadMarks Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) System

Treadmarks supports parallel computing on networks of workstations.
Its main novel feature is that it provides a global shared address
space across the different machines on a cluster.  The shared address
space distinguishes it from other well-known packages such as PVM that
provide a message passing interface between machines.  There is
growing consensus in the parallel computing community that a shared
memory interface is more desirable from the application programmer's
viewpoint, allowing him or her to focus on algorithmic development
rather than on managing communication.  The challenge in providing a
shared memory interface is to do so efficiently.  To this end,
TreadMarks incorporates several innovative features, including release
consistency and multiple-writer protocols.

Current research going on in the TreadMarks project includes the
integration of compiler and runtime techniques, the use of high-level
synchronization operators, and the use of multithreading, in
particular on multiprocessor nodes.  TreadMarks runs on IBM, DEC, SUN,
HP, x86 (running FreeBSD 2.1R or Linux Slackware 3.0) and SGI hardware.  
C, C++, and Fortran are supported.  TreadMarks was developed with support 
from the Texas Advanced Technology Program (TATP). 

TreadMarks is being distributed at a small cost to universities and 
nonprofit institutions.
