Visual Design of Analog Computers



Visual Design of Analog Computers
Description: 

Analog field computers have a strongly visual component in their design. Whether the analogy is concrete (such as to a butterfly wing) or abstract (such as to a matrix of quaternions), the ability to design a field computer depends on the ability to visualize the system. Our research involves defining the transformations used to map a system to an analog computer, and formalizing the inference methods used in visual design.
