SFU Hardware Design Group

SFU Hardware Design Group

The activities of the faculty involved in digitial hardware design
range from practical to theoretical, with most of our activity falling
into two broad areas: the design and implementation of novel computer
architectures, and the development of algorithms for computer-aided
design and design automation. The computer architecture research also
provides a framework for device and circuit design, design for
testability, and software tools for design and implementation of very
large scale integrated circuits. The research in computer aided design
and design automation explores the problems of high-level synthesis and
scheduling, using both formal representations and heuristics, with
emphasis on provable performance, correctness, and optimal design.
