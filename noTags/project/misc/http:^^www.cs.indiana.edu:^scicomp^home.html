Program Description 

The computational science group in the 
Computer Science Department is part of the
Scientific Computing Program at 
Indiana University, 
which includes representatives from the 
Chemistry, 
Mathematics, 
Physics, 
Geological Sciences, and 
Astronomy Departments.
The program is a formal recognition of changes
in science that have been prominent for the last 15 years, changes that
have introduced a powerful and entirely new mode of research based on using computer
modeling, data analysis and visualization.
  

Scientific computing involves all aspects of tackling problems, and typically includes the
formulation of a description of the physics of a problem,
the development of a mathematical model of the physical
problem, the selection or creation of algorithms to solve the equations in the mathematical
model, the implementation on a computer, the analysis and validation of the computer
results, and visualization of the results.  Carrying out research in this area is
necessarily multidisciplinary, calling on advanced skills in areas that span
many classical divisions of academia.  Modern advances in computational science typically
involve teams of researchers with a variety of skills and interests.
  

Computer scientists are a key component in the mix needed for a good scientific computing
team.  Although dusting off a numerical analysis program and labeling it ``scientific
computing'' can help draw more attention and grant money,
scientific computing is not numerical analysis, it is not the analysis of algorithms,
it is not high performance computing, and it is not computer graphics,
but it instead consists of the combination of all
those fields (and others) to craft solution strategies for applied problems.
  

A good example that can illustrate aspects of computer science and its role in computational
science is
computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

The Scientific Computing Group is closely allied with the
Extreme Computing Group
and has work connected with the
Center for Innovative Computing Applications.
