 ARCADE-PROJECT 




 ARCADE-Project


Architectural Computer-Aided Design and Evaluation


Principal Investigator: 
Carlo H. Séquin

This project is loosely coupled with research going on in the Department of Architecture
in the College of Environmental Design.
We explore the constructions of a database to store generic knowledge about
the design of institutional buildings as well as specific information
about particular projects such as Soda Hall.



This research is closely linked with:



The WALKTHRU Project


Another important component are a couple of experimental classes offered in 1995 and 1996:




CS 294-5: ARCHITECTURAL CAD: (Spring 1995)


CS 294-5: ARCHITECTURAL CAD: (Spring 1996): "ARCAD'96"



Here are some of the projects in progress:


Developing tools to make building model generation easier.

Rick Lewis:

1995 Abstract:
 Building Model Generation
 1996 ILP Presentation:
The BMG Building Model Generator
Integrating the Soda Hall model with the CFAST fire simulator.

Rick Bukowski:
 
Interactive Walkthru Environments for Simulation
A Study of the database issues concerning the description of architectural projects

with Prof. Yehuda Kalay, CED, Dept. of Architecture

A Study of efficient data structures to represent building model plans
at various levels of abstraction, capturing the duality
between spaces and the physical elements that define them

Laura Downs:
  Symbolic Layout Tools for Architectural Design
