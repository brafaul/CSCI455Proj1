 Sound Probabilistic Reasoning Project (SPR) 
 
Primary Investigator:   Eric Neufeld  .


The SPR project considers probabilistic approaches to a variety of
AI problems traditionally handled by logics, grammars, or heuristics.
Students in the past have look at approximate reasoning, natural language,
reasoning about time, and classification of data.

   Logic programming 
 
Working jointly with   Tony Kusalik  , some
students are investigating problems in logic programming, including
abstract interpretation and visual unification.
