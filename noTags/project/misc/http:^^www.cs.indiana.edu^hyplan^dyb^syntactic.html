Syntactic Abstraction

Syntactic Abstraction 
Description: 

Traditional macros used to extend programming languages suffer from
semantic difficulties due to unintended variable bindings that occur as
the result of the code transformations specified by macro
transformers.
We have developed the concept of hygienic (lexically scoped) macros
and are continuing to refine the concept of syntactic abstraction and
render it usable for a wider variety of applications.
