Research Goals


The Proteus Project is a project of research and development in
natural language processing, conducted in the Department of Computer
Science, New York University, under the direction of 
Prof. Ralph Grishman.  

 The basic research is focussed on the automated acquisition of
linguistic knowledge from large corpora.  We are developing methods for
the acquisition of probabilistic grammars, semantic relations between
words, and selectional patterns.

 This research is tied to applications in four areas:

  information retrieval 
     (the retrieval of documents from large collections)
  information extraction 
     (extracting information about particular types of events from free text)
  machine translation
  language modeling for speech recognition




Projects


 
Comlex Syntax (creation of a syntactic lexicon of English)

 
Tipster architecture
     (a standard architecture for information retrieval and extraction)

 
MUC-6 (evaluation metrics for natural language systems)

 
 Information Extraction 
 
 Language Modeling for Speech Recognition 
 
 Machine Translation 
 
 Domain Project
