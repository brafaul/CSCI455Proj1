 Case-Based Selection of Problem Solving Methods for
Scientific Computation 

 Case-Based Selection of Problem Solving Methods for
Scientific Computation 
Description: 

This project applies case-based reasoning to the problem of
selecting methods for solving sparse linear systems in scientific
computation.  Because there are no "hard-and-fast" rules to
determine which solvers apply, the experience-based reasoning of CBR
is a particularly promising method for solver selection.  The goal
is to develop algorithms that can automatically learn which methods to
apply to different problems on different types of hardware, and to
publicly distribute an implementation of these algorithms with the
solvers being developed as part of the I.U.  
HyperMatrix project in scientific computation.
