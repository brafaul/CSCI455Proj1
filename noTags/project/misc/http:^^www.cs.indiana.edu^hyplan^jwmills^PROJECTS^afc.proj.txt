Analog Field Computing



Analog Field Computing
Description: 

Analog field computing addresses the theory, design, implementation, and applications of analog computers including at least one component that can be treated mathematically as a field.  VLSI field computers were first implemented at Indiana University's Analog VLSI and Robotics Laboratory. They are currently being applied as artificial neural field networks, silicon retinas and controllers for Stiquito and Robozoa robots, morphogenesis simulators, controllers for the IU cyclotron, and matrix preconditioners.
