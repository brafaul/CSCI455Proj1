Scheme language implementation

Scheme language implementation
Description: 

The Scheme programming language is the vehicle for much of our programming
languages research.
Our work on Scheme implementation serves to further understanding of
imperative functional language implementation as well as to improve the
utility of Scheme as a research vehicle.
Our research includes work on storage management, control
representation, program analysis, code optimization, register
allocation, OOP subsystems, and run-time compilation.
