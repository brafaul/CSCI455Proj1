SFU Database Systems Group

Research in the area of database systems ranges from relational
databases to distributed, intelligent, and heterogeneous data- and
knowledge-bases, and their applications. Faculty interests include the
design and implementation of extended-relational, object-oriented and
deductive database systems, query processing and query optimization,
concurrency control, recovery, and transaction management in
traditional distributed databases and heterogeneous multi-databases,
fault-tolerant distributed databases, spatial databases, knowledge
discovery in databases, multimedia databases, natural language
interfaces to database systems, and database applications in
engineering and geographic information systems.

The Database Systems Group is actively involved in placing
