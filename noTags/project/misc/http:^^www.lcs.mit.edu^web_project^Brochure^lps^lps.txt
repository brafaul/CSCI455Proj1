LARGE-SCALE PARALLEL SOFTWARE GROUP










 William E. Weihl,Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering





Researchers in the Large-scale Parallel Software Group
develop new and easier methods of writing efficient
parallel programs. Some of the projects in the group are
conducted jointly with the Parallel and Distributed
Operating Systems Group.

Current research is conducted in three major areas. First,
work that was begun on the Prelude system is continuing in
the AutoPilot project with compiler modifications for C and
other widely used languages. The goal of this work is to
develop compiler and runtime system mechanisms that raise
the level of abstraction of parallel programs, thus making
it easier to port or tune a program.

Secondly, we are studying architectural and operating
system support for low-overhead communication in
multi-programmed, multi-user systems. Our goal is to
combine the speed of today's high-performance
multiprocessors with the protection guarantees of
distributed systems.

Thirdly, we are developing new techniques for
high-performance simulation of multiprocessor systems. Work
now under way focuses on a parallel implementation of
Proteus, our single-processor simulator.

Finally, group members are involved in several projects
dedicated to designing and evaluating parallel algorithms
and applications.
