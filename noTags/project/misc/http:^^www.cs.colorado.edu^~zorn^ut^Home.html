Research on Ubiquitous Telepresence




Research on Ubiquitous Telepresence



 UT Project Statement 
The main idea of ubiquitous
telepresence (UT) is to allow users to project their physical presence
anywhere on the internet.  Specifically, users are given the ability
to explore and interact with many remote physical environments (e.g.,
all sites on the internet) through remote sensing and manipulation
devices.  The plan for implementing ubiquitous telepresence is to
build robotic or remote-controlled units (which we have called
``ubots'') at such low cost that they become as ubiquitous as
television sets.
