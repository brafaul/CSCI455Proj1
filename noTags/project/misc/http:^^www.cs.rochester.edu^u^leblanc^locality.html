Locality Management

Locality Management in Large-Scale Multiprocessors

This project is developing techniques that improve locality of reference
in parallel programs, so as to admit efficient execution on large-scale
multiprocessors.
We use a combination of simulation, analytic studies,
and experimentation to compare alternative techniques for
locality management under various architectural assumptions, using
a wide variety of benchmark applications.
We seek to quantify the performance impact of individual techniques
at the architecture,
operating system, runtime library, and user level, and the
interaction between techniques across layers in the system.
This work will lead to a better understanding of the role of locality
and data sharing in parallel program performance, and a
comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of techniques
for locality management and their interactions.

The Mint Multiprocessor Simulator
MINT is a software package designed to
ease the process of constructing event-driven memory hierarchy
simulators for multiprocessors.  It provides a set of simulated
processors that run standard Unix executable files compiled for
a MIPS R3000 based multiprocessor.  These generate multiple
streams of memory reference events that drive a user-provided
memory system simulator.  MINT uses a novel hybrid technique
that exploits the best aspects of native execution and software
interpretation to minimize the overhead of processor simulation.
Combined with related techniques to improve performance, this
approach makes simulation on uniprocessor hosts extremely efficient.
Mint is available without charge to academic and research sites.
