TELEMEDIA, NETWORKS, AND SYSTEMS GROUP 

hardware
and software
- of the pending transition from computation intensive
applications to media and network intensive environments.
While our interests extend to audio and graphics, much of
the effort is focused on full motion video, which
represents the medium with the most demanding through-put
requirement.  Specifically, the project investigates the
design and deployment of distributed video systems.  This
project is integrating Desk Area Network (DAN) technology,
under development within Aurora, with a very software
intensive approach to the capture, editing, transmission,
storage, and display of full motion video sequences. 
Aurora's main objective is the exploration and evaluation
of technologies that support operation at or near gigabit
per second bandwidths. Our contributions to Aurora, which
are mostly related to gigabit endworking, include work on
local distribution, host interfacing, and end system
protocol software.

Aurora is one of five networking testbeds funded by the
Corporation for the National Research Initiatives under a
grant from the National Science
Foundation and ARPA.
This collaboration involves MIT, IBM, Bellcore, and the University of Pennsylvania.
The project has already commissioned a wide area network,
through which the four partner sites are linked by several
600 Mb/s trunks.
