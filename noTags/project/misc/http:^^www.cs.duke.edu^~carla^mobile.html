Specific Projects


Masters degree students, Nasrin  Azarbayejani Gaffaney and John MacDonald, have been working together
on SMARDI, a system to provide an interface into a full-fledged mobile
file system (such as CODA) for very limited mobile devices (PDA's).
This was a collaboration with the CODA group at CMU.

Ph.D. student, Surendar Chandra, is working on Jello, a framework for building mobile
applications that can adapt to the kinds of changing environmental
characteristics that mobility encourages (applications that will
experience varying power, connectivity, bandwidth, etc).
