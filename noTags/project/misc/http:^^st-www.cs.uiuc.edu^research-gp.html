Request to be notified when this page changes.

The UIUC Smalltalk/Patterns Research Group is located at the Department of Computer Science at the
University of Illinois in 
Urbana-Champaign.  Under the direction of Dr. Ralph Johnson, the members of the UIUC
Smalltalk Group have been using Smalltalk 80 since 1985.  While they
are not the only research group on campus using Smalltalk, they
are the group that is the most devoted to using Smalltalk. (Another is
the wOrlds
project)

We maintain an archive of source code and information about 
Smalltalk.

Here is an article about why a hot-air balloon 
is the symbol of Smalltalk.
