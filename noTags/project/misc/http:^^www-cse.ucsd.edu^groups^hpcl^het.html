Fran Berman



Silvia Figueira
 Silvia has just defended her PhD thesis (12/13/96)
and is now a Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSD. She has
been working on modeling the effects of contention on
the behavior of applications in multi-user environments.


Jennifer Schopf
 Jenny is a fifth year graduate student.  Her
research has been in developing a performance model for
heterogeneous applications and in evaluating required
information for performance predictions.


Gary Shao
 Gary is a fourth year graduate student.  His current
project involved examining the effects of dynamically
rebalancing data distributions given accurate runtime system
and network load information.



Richard Wolski
 Rich is a research faculty at UCSD, formerly of LLNL.  His
work involves 
predicting network performance for heterogeneous systems
and the development of the  Network Weather
Service.


Cosimo Anlgano
 Mino is a researcher at the Univeristy of
Torino, Italy.


Leesa Hicks
 Leesa graduated in January 1996 with her Master's
degree after 
finishing her thesis on  Pangaea,
