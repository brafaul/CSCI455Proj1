 Description :

We are developing a new abstraction,
called a flexible shared window,
that allows users to efficienty see different
views of a
shared window.
Specifically, we are
investigating multiple, linked versions of a shared window,
dynamic migration
and replication of window clients,
a hierarchical, file-system-like naming scheme for distributed windows,

a distributed window architecture

that inverts the traditional architecture,
and a modular implementation scheme based on the notion
of connecting protocol filters.
If successful,
this research will lead to a new class of systems,
called flexible shared window systems,
that can be used to more flexibly and efficiently share

existing collaboration-unaware applications/toolkits

and more easily implement
new

collaboration-aware applications/ toolkits.

We propose to implement on top of both the X window system and the Java
window layer.
