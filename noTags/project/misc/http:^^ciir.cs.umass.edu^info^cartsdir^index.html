Center for Autonomous, Real-Time Systems (CARTS)
Welcome to CARTS!
Center for Autonomous, Real-Time Systems


 
Part of the Center for
Real-Time and Intelligent Complex Computing Systems (CRICCS), the Center for Autonomous Real-Time Systems (CARTS) serves as the administrative mechanism for the Vision and Robotics Laboratory and the Real-Time Kernel Laboratory. 

CARTS
explores the integration of technologies from robotics, real-time AI, computer
vision, and real-time computing for use in uncertain and real-time
environments. CARTS is application domain driven and is currently focused on
applying these technologies to the flexible manufacturing processes although
many other applications are envisioned.
