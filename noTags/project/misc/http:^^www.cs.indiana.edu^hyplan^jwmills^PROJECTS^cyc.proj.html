Indiana University Cyclotron Controller



Indiana University Cyclotron Controller
Description: 

This joint project with the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility applies analog field computers as real-time controllers for the dipole and quadrupole electromagnets in the IUCF beam line. Simplicity, adjustability, and rapid response to changing conditions are achieved with a digitally-reconfigurable VLSI field computer that has an analog computation path, and includes an integrated simulator to compute beam moments from non-invasive beam position monitors. The prototype controller is a 2mm x 2mm MOSIS "TinyChip".
