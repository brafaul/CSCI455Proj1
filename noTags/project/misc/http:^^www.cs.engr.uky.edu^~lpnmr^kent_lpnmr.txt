Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning at Kentucky
LPNMR AT KENTUCKY
Logic 
programming and nonmonotonic reasoning  (LPNMR) is an active research
area in the  Computer Science Department 
 at the  University of Kentucky. 
The research group consists of three faculty of the Department:


   V. Wiktor Marek 
   Mirek Truszczynski 
   Arcot Rajasekar 


These researchers work with a group of students including 
 Pawel Cholewinski ,
 Artur Mikitiuk ,  Joseph Oldham ,  
and Bill Brooks. Main research topics are:


  DERES - a Default Reasoning System
  TheoryBase - a workbench for experimenting with LPNMR
  Complexity and expressibility of LPNMR
  Revision programming
  Default Logic
  Disjunctive Logic Programming
  String Logic
