 Purpose 

The goal of the Computer Visualization Laboratory (CVL) is to investigate
methodologies for integrating computing and visual communication, to
explore technologies that make feasible the fusion between the two, and
to provide state-of-the-art video production and multimedia publication
capabilties for use in research and instruction.  The laboratory acquires,
promotes, and disseminates video and visualization technology and know-how
within the University and provides a research environment for the
activities of the  Concurrent Systems Group.


 Equipment 

The Computer Visualization Laboratory has unique broadcast-quality video
production facilities.  They include a sophisticated video camera and a
Panasonic video editing station which is capable of recording images from the
various computer displays and provides extensive video tape editing
capabilities.  Three SGI workstations offer high performance graphic rendering
capabilities and mey be accessed via the network in order to transfer
images to video tape for editing.  Two Macintosh computers form the core of
an expanding multimedia publication capability which includes scanners and a
photo-quality color printer.  

 Equipment List


 Services 
A growing number of researchers are taking advantage of the unique facilities
existing in the laboratory and of the Pavane system which offers sophisticated
visualizations without the burden of costly software development.  Recent
outside collaborations involve chemical engineering, electrical engineering,
physics, and medicine.
