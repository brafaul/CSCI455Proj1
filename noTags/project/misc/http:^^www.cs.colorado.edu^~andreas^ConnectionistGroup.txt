   Research Interests 

 The Boulder Connectionist Research Group (BCRG) group develops,
analyzes, implements, and tests machine learning algorithms, usually
framed as neural network learning algorithms.  Applications range from
cognitive science to science and engineering:


 Mozer: (see his home page)
