Logic and Computation





Logic and Computation

(formerly the Institute for Advanced Concepts in Programming
Language Theory)



The focus of this research group is on logic in computer science, with
particular interest in lambda calculus and functional programming, types,
constructive mathematics, proof theory, linear logic, and semantics.

 Our group is equipped with the usual array of workstations, backed
up by a complex of turbocharged multitape Turing Machines, a prototype
high-speed optimal reduction machine, and a type-directed partial
evaluator.


As of September 1996, we are running a weekly seminar on logic and programming language
theory, tentatively devoted to topics in linear logic and
extracting computational content from classical proofs.
