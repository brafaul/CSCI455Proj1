The CHAOS Project





The CHAOS research group at the University of Maryland College Park
has developed methods that are making it possible to produce portable 
compilers
and runtime libraries to map a broad range of challenging applications
onto high performance computer architectures. A major focus of this work
has been to develop techniques for irregular scientific problems, i.e.
problems that are unstructured, sparse, adaptive or block structured. The
group works extensively with 
applications
developers in many disciplines and with parallel compiler vendors.
Many of the concepts first described and prototyped by this project are
making their way into High
Performance Fortran during the ongoing second round of language 
definition.
This work is also leading to the development of runtime support ( Meta-Chaos
) to couple runtime libraries used in data and task parallel compilers.
Meta-Chaos is a central component for the common compiler runtime support
being developed by the Parallel
Compiler Runtime Consortium.
We are currently developing techniques that will allow parallel compute
and data objects to offer their services to remotely connected clients.
The goal is to develop techniques that will make it possible to compose
programs running on any combination of distributed memory, shared memory
or networked microcomputers or workstations. We are motivating this research
by software interoperability scenarios associated with two classes of 
applications.
The first class is sensor data processing and integration, and the second
is complex physical simulations. We have developed early prototypes of
our data parallel program coupling software and have employed our prototype
to demonstrate the ability to couple separately executing High Performance
Fortran programs, and to couple High Performance Fortran programs with
applications developed using the Maryland CHAOS and Multiblock Parti 
libraries.
Based upon our experiences in developing runtime libraries and 
parallelizing
applications, we have developed several compilation
techniques. Our goal is to be able to automate our hand 
parallelization/optimization
techniques through the use of compilers. We have employed the Fortran~D
compilation system (developed primarily at Rice University) as the
infrastructure for implementation of our techniques.
For generating efficient code from applications having multiple levels
of indirection, we have developed an index flattening technique (based
upon the notion of program slicing). This technique transforms a loop having
multiple levels of indirection into a series of loops having at most a
single level of indirection. We have also observed that aggressive 
interprocedural
optimizations are required to deal with large applications that have 
irregular
accesses to data or large I/O requirements. We have developed an 
Interprocedural
Partial Redundancy Elimination (IPRE) technique for performing 
interprocedural
placement of communication preprocessing and collective communication 
statements.
We are currently working on Interprocedural Balanced Code Placement (IBCP),
which will allow us to overlap computation and communication across procedure
boundaries. We are also working on generating distributed memory code from
Fortran~90 codes that use pointers and recursive data structures. -by Joel
