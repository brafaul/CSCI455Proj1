 Theoretical Computer Science Group 



In 1986 the Computer Science Department established a new research group in 
Theoretical Computer Science. The group has now grown to a point where it 
contains faculty specializing in a diverse spectrum of research areas.
The group maintains strong ties with researchers in the five-college
area and benefits from its proximity to other leading institutions of 
the Northeast US. It has also become an important resource to other research 
groups within the Department.
