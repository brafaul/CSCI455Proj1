 Welcome to the 
Texas A&M University
Robotics Group World Wide Web information center.


"Theory is when you know everything but nothing works.
Practice is when everything works but no one knows why.
In our lab, theory and practice are combined: nothing works and no one
knows why."
                 -author unknown


The Robotics Group comprises faculty and students from the
departments of Computer
Science, Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics,
and Electrical Engineering.  Areas of research include assembly planning, calibration,
dexterous manipulation, distributed simulation, fine-motion planning, 
and telerobotics. We are now part of the 
Center for Fuzzy Logic, Robotics, and Intelligent Systems.
