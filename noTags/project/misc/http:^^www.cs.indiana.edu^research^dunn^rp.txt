 Relevant Predication 

 Relevant Predication 
Description:   This research program
attempts to give a formal theory of predication within the context of
relevance logic. For an implication to be "relevant" there must be
some connection between its antecedent and consequent.
Correspondingly, in order for a predication to be relevant, there must
be some connection between the predicate and the term of which it is
predicated. This project in philosophical logic has a link to the
computer science notion of a "strict function" (one that depends on
its arguments).  A definition of relevant predication can be given
within relevance logic with identity, and its formal properties are
being explored and linked with various ontological issues concerning
predication. This include vacuous predication, external relations, the
question of whether existence is a property and whether membership and
exemplification are relations. There are also applications to the
philosophy of science in connection with the Goodman "grue-bleen"
paradox and other paradoxes of confirmation. Applications have also
been made to the frame problem in AI and by Raymundo Morado to
non-monotonic reasoning (treating relevant predication as default
predication).
