MCML : The Mobile Computing and Multimedia Laboratory at the University of 
Maryland













This page is under construction. Bear with us.



Objective

The goal of this laboratory is to investigate issues in mobile computing
and multimedia and to find solutions to the technical problems in these
areas.  The future integration of these two technologies will also require
solutions to the specific problems that arise with these combined.



Currently we are looking at wireless and mobility problems such as
routing protocols and algorithms, resource and service location protocols,
performance evaluation of NFS and TCP, and mechanism to improve throughput
over wireless links.  On multimedia and ATM networks,
we are concerned with (video) data encoding and compression, resource
allocation, traffic characterization and shaping, and multimedia
teleconferencing.  We are also working on designing a new class of operating
system especially suitable for multimedia applications.
