Trainable Modular Vision System
 This project is a joint undertaking of MIT's AI Lab and CBCL
(the Center for Biological and Computational Learning at MIT). Funding
is received under the ONR Multidisciplinary University Research
Initiative (MURI). The principal scientific issues underlying the work
of this project are those of learning and vision. Other research
undertaken by the group will tackle, inter alia, complexity of
learning, training set size, prior information, self-configurable
learning networks, performance analysis and also steerable pyramid and
attention mechanism. A series of online report summaries on
projects funded fully or in part under MURI can be accessed here
or by clicking on the Applications link, below.
