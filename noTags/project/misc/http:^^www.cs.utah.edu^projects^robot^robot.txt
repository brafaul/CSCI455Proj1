Vision and Robotics











 Research 

The vision and robotics group investigates a broad range of problems
in computer vision, sensing for manfacturing, and robotics.  Much of
this work involves interdisciplinary, multi-investigator efforts.  The
group works closely with the 
Alpha_1 group and Utah's Center for Engineering Design.
