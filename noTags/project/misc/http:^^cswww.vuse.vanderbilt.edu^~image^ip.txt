Computer Science Image Processing Laboratory 
 




Welcome to the homepage of the Computer Science Image Processing Lab (IPLAB).
The group works with  
Dr. J. Michael Fitzpatrick  in the field of Medical Imaging and Image
Processing. Current research interests of the lab 
include algorithms and validation methods for registration of medical images, 
correction of geometric distortion in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, localization
of fiducial markers in brain images, and image guided neurosurgery.
This lab is part of a multi-disciplinary 
Stereotactic Image Processing 
Society (SIPS) involving faculty and students from the 
 Departments of 
Computer Science ,  Electrical and Computer Engineering , 
 
Biomedical Engineering , Neurosurgery, Psychiatry, and 
Radiology and Radiological Sciences.
