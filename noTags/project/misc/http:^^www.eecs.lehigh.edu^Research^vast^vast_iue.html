The IUE is a public domain, comprehensive software environment for
performing advanced research in Image
Understanding (IU). The primary goal of the IUE is to promote research
productivity and to facilitate the exchange of research results among IU
researchers.  To this end, the IUE provides

 an extensive C++ class hierarchy for representing a wide
     range of objects, images, image features, and processes
 a well-documented, modular, standard object-oriented interface
 implementation of established IU algorithms
 the ability to exploit and coordinate the processing power of exitsing
     IU tools and systems



In August 1993, ARPA announced the award
of the prime development contract for the Image Understanding Environment
(IUE) to Amerinex Artificial
Intelligence, `.  Inc.  AAI is currently in the second year of a staged
three-year development effort to implement the IUE.



The development of the IUE will be performed in close coordination with 
the continued development of other Amerinex's other IU products.  In
particular, the KBVision (TM) System will
continue to be enhanced, and as appropriate, compatibility products will be
developed to allow users of KBVision System products to exchange data with
IUE users.
