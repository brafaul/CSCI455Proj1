USTAT Intrusion Detection System


USTAT

State Transition Analysis Tool for UNIX



USTAT is a real-time rule-based intrusion detection system for SunOS4.1.x and
Solaris 2.x.

Background and History

Phillip Porras introduced the concept of STAT as his master's thesis; STAT 
is an expert system which detects intrusions using a state transition table.
You can retrieve an abstract of this thesis, or the full text (2.7M, postscript).

Koral Ilgun implemented STAT as a real-time intrusion detection system for
UNIX; hence U_STAT.  Click here for an abstract of his master's  thesis, and here for the full text (1.2M, postscript).  This implementation runs under SunOS 4 and makes use of the SunOS BSM
Audit Trail.

This project has been and is under the supervision of Dr. Richard Kemmerer.

Current Work

Jonathan Wood has ported USTAT to Solaris 2.x, and is currently investigating
approaches to a distributed intrusion detection system using USTAT.  This 
system will collect data from multiple hosts on a network and process the
data as a unified audit trail.  Other research directions include 
incorporating USTAT with other IDS which complement its capabilities (i.e.
anomaly detection systems), and expanding its auditing capabilities to take
advantage of the extra information gleaned from gathering audit data from
networked machines.
