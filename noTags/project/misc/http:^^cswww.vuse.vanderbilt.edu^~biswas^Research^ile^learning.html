Intelligent Learning Environments

Summary

The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (CTGV) is
developing the Jasper Woodbury Problem Solving Series, a 
videodisc based program
designed to motivate students and help them learn to think and
reason mathematically about complex realistic problems.
As part of this project, we are developing a collection of
computer-based
learning environments that incorporate the project's
constructivist theories, generative learning techniques, and
anchoring macrocontexts into an Intelligent Learning 
Environment design.
The resulting paradigm Macrocontexts Plus Microworlds
(MPMs), where microworld exploration and problem solving is 
anchored within an interesting macrocontext.  

Two systems we have constructed and tested are:

 AdventurePlayer, a 
trip planning microworld that can be anchored to a Jasper
macrocontext.  
This system allows students to construct, evaluate, and reason
about 
solutions to trip planning problems, and 

 SmartTools, also linked
to a trip planning microworld, where students study and develop
graphical
tools to quickly answer various questions about distance, time,
rate and
gas consumption. This system has also been used as a test bed
for
studying the richness of computer traces for protocol analysis.


Both systems incorporate beneficial aspects of both
intelligent tutoring systems and cognitive tools through
reflective interaction, scaffolding, and coaching.  

Current work in this area is focusing on an ONR-sponsored
project for
studying student understanding of AC-circuit concepts.  The goal
is to develop appropriate instructional methodologies and
computer-based
environments for training technicians in complex maintenance and
troubleshooting tasks.
