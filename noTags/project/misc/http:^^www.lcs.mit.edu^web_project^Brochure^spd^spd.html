  SYSTEMATIC PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT GROUP               John Guttag,Group Head  Stephen Garland,Principal Research Scientist  Mark T. Vandevoorde, Research Scientist     The Larch project is designed to help produce high-qualitycomputer systems through the practical application ofrigorous methods of software and hardware design,development, and maintenance.Collaborating with systems designers, we study methods for"decomposing" designs into modules with well-definedinterfaces and specifying the behavior of these interfaces.This approach makes it easier to reason about designs,since one can rely on specifications instead of examiningimplementations.An extensive set of support tools is an important part ofLarch. Some of the tools are lightweight -- that is, theyare quick and easy to use. LCLint, for example, supportsprogramming with data abstractions in ANSI C by detectingobvious conflicts between code and interfacespecifications.Other tools are more heavyweight and so require more timeand expertise. The theorem-proving system called LP, forinstance, supports reasoning (in first-order logic) aboutthe properties of abstractions and designs. Proofs, likedesigns, must be created, debugged, and maintained. SinceLP is used early in the design process to find designflaws, it treats proving as an activity similar toprogramming. All Larch tools support incrementaldevelopment in that they work with partial specifications,but repay larger specification investments with largerdividends in analysis.The Larch project is becoming increasingly involved withthe design of parallel and distributed systems. Our aim isto develop a useful set of abstractions and implementationtechniques for producing concurrent interactive symbolicapplications.
