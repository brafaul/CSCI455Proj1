TRANSOPEN Project
TRANSOPEN Project
Center for Information Management Research, Georgia Tech


The mission of the TRANSOPEN project is to research and improve the state of
the art in transitioning to Open Systems technology. 
 Melody Moore is the
Principal Investigator of this project. There are currently 15 
 faculty
and students  working on the TRANSOPEN project.  In 1992, the TRANSOPEN
team focused on identifying relevant Department of Defense (DOD) and Industry
standards, and assessing the availability and maturity of Open Systems
software. The team also performed experiments and developed research
prototypes to assess transition feasibility. TRANSOPEN research also included
studies of business processes and software engineering techniques and methods
for transition.

In  1992-93  work progressed in several 
areas: Open System Standards, Operating Systems, User Interfaces, Networking, 
Reverse Engineering and Tools, and Enterprise Analysis. 

Major Technological Issues/Approaches for 
1993 and 1994 will build on last year's work, studying techniques, 
methods, and strategies for advancing the state of the art in Open Systems 
transition.
