Algorithms for Quadtree Representation of Matrices


Algorithms for Quadtree Representation of Matrices
Description:

Rather than decomposing matrices into rows, columns or tiny blocks,
we decompose them
	
recursively into quadrants.
	
The array becomes a tree which still might be stored sequentially,
and decompostion of the problem for multiprocessing
follows the subtrees.
We explore this structure
as an exercise of the thesis that functional programming
is ideal for multiprocessing;
the resulting algorithms are expressed in C for better performance.


Opportunites for ``new'' algorithms abound.
Sparse matrices have many empty subtrees, and simple algebra there;
so, uniform algorithms can be applied to both sparse and nonsparse problems.
Search problems (e.g. pivoting) steer by summary
information that ``decorates'' interior nodes of the tree.
Under Gaussian elimination, a nonsingular subtree of any order
can be eliminated at any step;
the resulting
	
``undulant'' pivoting
	
has been developed
for both
exact and
	
floating-point decomposition
	
.
