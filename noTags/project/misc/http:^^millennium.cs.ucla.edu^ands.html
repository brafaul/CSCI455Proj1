Advanced Networking and Distributed Systems (ANDS)
Principal Investigator: Leonard Kleinrock




This project investigates the architecture and the fundamental behavior of 
distributed computer communication systems from an analytical as well as from 
a simulation point of view, the emphasis being on analytical.  In addition, 
this project implements the understanding of these systems.
