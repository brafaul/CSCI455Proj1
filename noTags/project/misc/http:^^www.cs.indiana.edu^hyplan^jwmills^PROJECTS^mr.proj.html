Minimalist Robotics



Minimalist Robotics
Description: 

Minimalist robotics uses large numbers of simple, inexpensive robots to study emergent computation in systems of interacting agents. At Indiana University we are using the hexapod Stiquito robot that was invented here in 1992 to create a Stiquito colony. A new project involves large numbers (100-1000) of robot bacteria, called Robozoa, to study field computation with physical agents.
