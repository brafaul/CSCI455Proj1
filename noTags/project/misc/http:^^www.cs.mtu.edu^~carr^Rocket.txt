Description:

The goals of the Rocket project are to develop a retargetable compiler for
instruction-level parallel architectures and to develop scheduling and register allocation
algorithms for said architectures.  This project 
intimately
is entwined with the Memoria project. Current research efforts
include software pipelining, register-sensitive scheduling, and register allocation and
scheduling for partitioned register files.
