A full list of publications can be found at the latter portion
of this page.
Gradually, abstracts of these publications
will be placed on line in html
form, with pointers to subsequent work, raw data, reader comments,
and other material appropriate for an addendum. 
A list of current online reports or addenda are given first.


 Online Reports and Addenda 
In many cases, technical reports and electronic addenda of published work
will be placed on line here in both postscript
and html format (though not necessarily at the same time).
Your comments are welcome. In certain of these cases,
should you email comments regarding 
related literature, suggestions for experimental or theoretical 
improvements, alternative viewpoints, then your comments, if reasonable
and informative, they will be linked to the html version of the technical 
report (or addendum) and under a separate list of comments -- unless
you state that you do not want this to be done. I may also
link responses to your comments, but not before getting your feedback
on a response. 


Comments on purely style issues are welcome, but they probably will not 
be linked in. Others who view the technical report will be free 
to view your comments as well. If your comments inform a revision 
of the report (e.g., for publication), then I will acknowledge them 
as a personal communication, or otherwise cite the literature that 
you relate (if I deem it relevant). If your comments are online and 
linked to a report, then you agree to allow others to cite 
them as personal communication as well (again, unless you state
that your comments should not be linked).


The following is a list of technical report titles, addenda, etc.
that are currently
online. These are links to either postscript versions of the paper,
or html `headers' that allow access
to postscript and html versions.
