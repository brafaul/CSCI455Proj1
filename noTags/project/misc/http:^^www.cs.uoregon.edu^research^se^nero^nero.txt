Introduction

The NERO distance learning project is an attempt to bring together
students and faculty from the different campuses in the Oregon State
System of Higher Education, in a geographically dispersed
collaborative learning exercise.  Students situated at the University
of Oregon (Eugene), Oregon State University (Corvallis), Portland
State University (Portland, OR), and the Oregon Graduate Institute
(Beaverton, OR), will work together (during Summer 1994) on software
engineering projects.
