Plausible Inference, Classification, and Default Logics



Plausible Inference, Classification, and Default Logics

The possibilities for unifying plausible inference, symbolic
learning for classification, non-monotonic logics on the basis of
probability and statistics are being explored.  This work has many
ramifications, ranging from computational learning theory to the
efficient use of probabilistic and statistical databases.
