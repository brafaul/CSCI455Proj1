The Zoo Homepage

 Welcome to the Zoo !



The Zoo is a collection of curious creatures from all over the
world. It comprises acknowledged experts in fields that are either
directly or tangentially related to cognitive research. Its members
have come to the MIT AI-Lab from
around the world to pursue both long- and short-term projects in our
individual specialities. Working independently, we explore different
topics surrounding the main question:  What is human
intelligence? 

We are part of the Cognobotics Group
and use Cog and
other technical devices as thinking tools, to explore - and sometimes
reconsider - our theories, which are based on the links between
anthropological theories and empirical studies on the nature of human
intelligence.

Within this ever-changing array of specialists from both science and
the humanities, new ides emerge from creative interaction.
