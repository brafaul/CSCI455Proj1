Transit Project Home Page

Welcome to the Transit Project's World Wide Web Home Page.  The MIT
Transit Project aims to design, build, program, and utilize novel
massively parallel MIMD computer architectures.  We utilize cutting
edge technology to achieve practical systems with a high degree of
both scalar and parallel performance.  To make very large computer
systems practical, we are concerned with fault-tolerance and
scalability. 

The MIT Transit project ran from roughly 1987 to 1994.  
This document serves as a central location for information produced by and
related to the Transit Project.  This information currently includes
conference papers, group working notes and an ftp site.  

For historical reasons, the name Transit is often applied to the set of
people who made up the project.  Several people involved with the original
Transit project now work on Abacus, a
SIMD architecture focussed on low-level computer vision applications.
The remaining Transit project members evolved into the reinventing  computing group. 

n.b. for work on adaptable and reconfigurable computing
including specialization theory, quasistatic computing, global cooperative 
computing, feedback directed specialization, and DPGAs, see the reinventing  computing home page.
