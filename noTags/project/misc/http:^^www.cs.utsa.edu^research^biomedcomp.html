Biomedical Computing Laboratory
Biomedical Computing Laboratory

The Biomedical Computing laboratory investigates
fundamental issues in biomedical computing.
The laboratory provides a multidisciplinary environment
for biomedical computing research. 
The laboraty supports a number of research project
involving biomedical research using computers.
Professor 

Bruce Rosen 
is director of the laboratory.
The laboratory is interested in developing algorithms
to detect salient clinical features from biological signals
and to aid physicians in medical decision making.


Our major research projects are:




Computer Aided Fetal Heart Rate Analysis 
to determine fetal well being and to determine fetal morbidity and mortality
from cardiotocographic tracings.



Computer Aided Dermatologic Analysis 
to distinguish between benign, premalignant, and malignant pigmented skin lesions.
