distributed interpretation of multi-source data in networks of partial
beliefs
LEARNING
(A. Balke, R. Dechter, J. Pearl, S.-W. Tan, T.
Verma)
structuring and parameterizing links in belief networks to form 
a representation consistent with a stream of observations
CONSTRAINT PROCESSING
(R. Ben-Eliyahu, A. Dechter, R. Dechter, J.  Pearl)
intelligent backtracking, learning while searching,
restructuring constraint networks, truth maintenance systems,
temporal reasoning

characterization of informational dependencies and their graph
representations
DEFAULT REASONING
(R. Ben-Eliyahu, H. Geffner, M. Goldszmidt, J. Pearl, S.-W. Tan)
