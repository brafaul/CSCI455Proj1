SPACE




SPACE




 SPACE 
is an approach to operating systems which uses multiple
protection domains rather than a single kernel to provide
operating system services.

Eliminating the monolithic kernel
allows the operating system to be written as a set of cooperating
application programs.  This has a great impact on the extensibility
and flexibility of the system.  Multiple instances of fundamental
paradigms, such as threads and virtual memory, can coexist, since
they are implemented as applications code.

All that is left in what was the operating system kernel is a set of
mechanisms to implement the protection domains.  In SPACE these

mechanisms.
can be replaced as needed by the application to provide a fundamental
level of extensibility not available in other adaptive operating
systems.
