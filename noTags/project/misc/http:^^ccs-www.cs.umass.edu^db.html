Database Systems Laboratory, Univ of Massachusetts







Database Systems Laboratory  Department of Computer Science 
University of Massachusetts, Amherst







The Database Systems Laboratory is part of the
 Computer Science Department at the

University of Massachusetts.  
Our current research 
activities deal with enhancing performance and availability of
applications that require transaction support through the use of
semantic information about the objects, operations, transaction model,
and the application.
