 Goal-Driven Interactive Explanation

 Goal-Driven Interactive Explanation 
Description: 

Explanations play a fundamental role in many artificial intelligence
tasks, but generating useful explanations remains a difficult
problem.  This project studies goal-driven interactive
explanation, an approach to explanation that combines aspects of
goal-driven learning and case-based reasoning to guide real-world
explanation.  The goal is to develop a pragmatic process for
generating useful explanations.  The model combines strategic
decision-making about when and what to learn with opportunistic
interaction within a dynamic environment.
