The Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) research group in the Department of Computer Science at the
University of Utah has ongoing research
projects in many areas of scientific computing: geometric modeling,
numerical analysis, parallel computing, scientific visualization, 
human-computer interaction, and software development tools.  Our
group is involved in both designing efficient and accurate tools for
scientific computing, and in utilizing these tools for scientific
applications.
