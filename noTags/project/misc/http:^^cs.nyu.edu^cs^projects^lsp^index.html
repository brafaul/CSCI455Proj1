Linguistic String Project


LINGUISTIC STRING PROJECT




Since 1965 the Linguistic String Project (LSP)
at New York University has engaged in Natural Language Processing
research.  Since 1975, the Project had developed methods of sublanguage
analysis, in particular, as applied to medical documents.   Applications
include extracting selected types of information from free text hospital
discharge summaries and clinic visit reports, and automatic coding of
patient information in the terms of a controlled medical vocabulary.

Major results include


 a parser and programming language for natural language grammars
[#1, #12 on selected bibliography], 
 a comprehensive computer grammar of English [#34],
 sublanguage methodology [#11, #13, #28],
 a Medical Language Processor (LSP-MLP) to convert narrative
clinical documents to a semantic representation, operative for English,
French and German [#33, #65, ,#82],
 a system of lexical categories now realized in
the COMLEX dictionary, and syntactic-sublanguage medical lexicons,
primarily in English and French.
