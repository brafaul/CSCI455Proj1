Human and Robot Hands



The group is 
headed by Dr. Kenneth
Salisbury. (This page is currently under construction and
very incomplete.) Other groups also headed by Ken are the Haptic
Interfaces Group and the Vision
and Touch Guided Manipulation Group.


The people in the Robot Hands Group are:

 Brian Anthony
   Brian Eberman (graduated)
   Susanna Leveroni
   John Morrell
 Vinay Shah

   Phantom as a Finger
  
Above is a photo of the Phantom as a
finger, with a six axis force/torque sensor. The device is being used
to touch and explore objects with force sensing.


   The Touch Observer
 The prototype touch
observer software monitors the vibration level measured by the force sensor
on the above finger and segments similiar components. By matching
these pieces to prior experience the touch observer can be used to
write event driven robot programs.
