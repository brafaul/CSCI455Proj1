The Distributed Systems Laboratory (DSL) is a hardware-oriented
academic and research facility, and is a part of the Computer and Information Science
 and  the 
Electrical Engineering  departments of the School of Engineering and Applied
Science at the University of
Pennsylvania.  The DSL is located on the first floor of the Moore
School, in Rooms 100 and 102.

DSL is split into two "organizational" halves.  Room 100 houses what
is known as Academic DSL, where laboratories for several
courses are held.  Several staff offices are also located inside.
Room 102, also called Research DSL, is home to research
facilities and graduate student offices.
