 Daisy/DSI Programming System 
 Daisy/DSI Programming System 
Description: 

DSI is an system for  symbolic multiprocessing 
based on the underlying operational model of  suspending construction .
The fundamental synchronization mechanism in this model is the
 suspension  a transparent object representing a computation.
Suspensions evolve into manifest data values, which can be inspected and
manipulated by other computations.  Computation is  demand oriented, 
a relaxation of demand-driven computation in which a system with available
processing resources can speculatively activate suspensions for bounded
execution.  We are interested in this model as a general basis for improving
the performance of limited-scale multiprocessors.

 Daisy  is a surface language for programming in the DSI system.
Daisy is an applicative language (a mutation of Scheme) with provisions for
exploiting a suspending list constructor.  Among these provisions are
constructs for building networks of streams, including windowing operations
for stream-based I/O.  These facilities make Daisy a good language for
modeling networks of self-timed communicating processes.
