The Education and Multimedia Systems group
at The George Washington University


The George Washington University, Department of Electrical Engineering 
and Computer Science, offers a traditional graduate program in computer 
science with eight areas of specialization. One of these areas, Education 
and Multimedia Systems, is a brand new area of specialization in the 
department based upon the growing demand for graduate study and 
research in this emerging interdisciplinary field. This area presents a 
unique combination of computer science, instructional design principles, 
and the latest multimedia hardware and software applications.


Courses in this area focus on the technical, pedagogical, and design skills 
necessary to prepare students to work or do advanced research in a field 
for which there is a high demand. The department offers three graduate 
courses that relate specifically to this area to enable graduate students 
to complete either a major or minor in this specialization, In addition, 
students have the opportunity to do independent research projects, to take 
additional courses in cognitive psychology and education, and to use the 
state of the art equipment in the Interactive Multimedia Research Lab.
