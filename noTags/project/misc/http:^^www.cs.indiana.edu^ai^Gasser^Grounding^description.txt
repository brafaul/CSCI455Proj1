 Grounding Linguistic Meaning 

 Grounding Linguistic Meaning 
Description: 

What does it mean for words and sentences to mean?
One approach to this very old question is to treat it from the
perspective of the young child who is learning to make sense
out of the world around it, a world which includes language.
For the child, language takes on significance as it is grounded
in experience, in perception, action, and affective states.
This project (which is just barely underway)
is concerned with modeling
(1) the development of the relation
between visual perception and the meanings of children's early
nouns, adjectives, and verbs
and (2) the evolution of word meaning.
