The long term goal of this
project is to develop a logic programming
system in which disjunction in the head of a clause and non-monotonic
negation in the body of the clause are allowed.  This goal is to be
achieved by appropriately combining classical deduction and 
non-monotonic reasoning systems.  More specifically, the project aims
to develop a disjunctive logic programming system based on
PROTEIN
theorem prover developed earlier by our

	Artificial Intelligence Research Group.



Funding
This project is funded by
Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),
a federal government agency that funds various basic research projects in
Germany.


Persons Involved
The project is headed by 
Prof.Dr. Ulrich Furbach
and
Dr. Jürgen Dix.
Two research scientists
Dr. Ilkka Niemelä
and
Dr. Chandrabose Aravindan
are working exculsively on this project.
In addition, Katrin Erk and
Dorothea Schäfer,
students working for their Master's degrees, are also involved in this project.
Marion Herrmann
is the project secretary.



Activities


 Jürgen Dix
     organized a
     Dagstuhl
   seminar on Disjunctive
   logic programming and databases: Non-monotonic aspects.

 The group participated in a workshop titled
     
     "Integrating Nonmonotonicity into Automated Reasoning Systems"
     during 
     ECAI '96.  Contact
     Ilkka Niemelä
     for more details.

 The group presented a
     poster
     at the
     poster session
     of
     JICSLP '96
 The group presented a
     system description at
     KI '96
 The group is organizing
     LPNMR '97.
     Contact
     Jürgen Dix or
     Chandrabose Aravindan
     for more details.

 The group will be organizing JELIA '98.  Contact
     Jürgen Dix or
     Ulrich Furbach
     for more details.

Related Projects


 This project is founded on an on-going DFG funded project on
     deduction and
     theory reasoning.
     The proposed disjunctive logic programming
     system is to be based on
     PROTEIN,
     a theorem prover developed during the course of the
     deduction project.

 For the project on disjunctive logic programming, non-trivial
     case studies in the area of information management are planned,
     and this has been conceived as a different project titled,
     
      "Deductive Techniques for Information Management Systems."
