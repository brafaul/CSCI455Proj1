Distributed Systems Group



Stanford University Distributed Systems Group


The Distributed Systems Group (DSG), led by Prof. David
R. Cheriton, is a research group in the Departments of Computer
Science and Electrical
Engineering at Stanford University.



Current Projects
The DSG has research projects in the following areas: 

High-performance Communication: very fast wide-area networks, network
interfaces, multiprocessor gateways, multicast, distributed systems architectures
and protocols, including Dissemination-Oriented Communication
Support. The PARADISE project serves as
an active testbed for much of this research. 
High-performance modular distributed operating systems, with particular
support for efficient distributed parallel execution of large-scale applications.
 
Parallel architecture, systems and programming, including hardware
development of a multiprocessor machine, parallel
operating systems and parallel and distributed application structuring.


The primary source of funding for this work is ARPA.
