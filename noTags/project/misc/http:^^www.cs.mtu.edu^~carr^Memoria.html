Description:

The goals of the Memoria project are to use source-level analysis to improve the memory
performance of advanced microprocessors.  Current research efforts include algorithms for
combining software prefetching and unroll-and-jam, automatic optimization of linear 
algebra codes, optimizing loop order for cache performance and using high-level analysis
in low-level code generation.  This project is intimately entwined with the 
Rocket project.
