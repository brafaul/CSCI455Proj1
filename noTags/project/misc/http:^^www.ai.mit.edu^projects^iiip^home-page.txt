Intelligent Information Infrastructure Project


 Intelligent Information Infrastructure Project
 M.I.T Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
 

The Intelligent Information Infrastructure Project seeks to develop an
extremely general system for distributing and retrieving information that will
work over major Internet protocols.  The early phases involve building
automated tools for managing outbound and inbound communications flows for
large organizations, whether via email, distributed hypermedia, or other
electronic media. After an initial phase of developing servers along these
lines, the project will turn to interactive tools for wide-area communication,
including a number of approaches to natural language understanding.  

The project grows out of an experiment run during the 1992 Presidential
election, when mail agents distributed campaign information, collected
questions from citizens, and allowed volunteers to organize. Interest in
political communication continues as members of the project work with the White House, the Congress, and Cambridge
Government. In one such project, hierarchical and adaptive survey technology
developed by the project was used in a survey over 1600 recipients of daily White
House Electronic Publications (summary results, survey
results). A wide-area collaboration system was developed and deployed in
the Vice
President's Open Meeting on the National Performance Review. A key
component of these systems, The Common LISP Hypermedia
Server, runs on all major Lisps and is freely distributed over the
Internet.  Working with local politicians, project members developed the first
Web site for a US Senator, Senator Kennedy and an early
city web site for the City of
Cambridge.
