Recent developments in interactive computer technology have placed greater importance on basic research and applied engineering for creating more humanly compatible computer interfaces. The demand for better understanding 
of this problem has stimulated the creation of a research program and associated laboratories at the University of Oregon. The Interactive Systems Group provides a valuable resource to the computer industrial community, the University, and the 
Computer and Information Science Department.
