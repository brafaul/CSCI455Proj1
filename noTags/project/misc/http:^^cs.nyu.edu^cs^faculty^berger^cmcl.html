 Computational Mathematics and Applied Analysis


Overview

The Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory (CMCL)
is a research center at the Courant Institute of New York University.
Our program is devoted to 
the formulation, analysis and numerical resolution
of a broad class of scientific problems, drawn from aerodynamics,
multi-phase flow, combustion, electromagnetic theory, nonlinear optics
and materials science. One component of the CMCL involves the design of
new schemes for partial differential equations,
particularly those which support adaptive mesh refinement, fast
algorithms, and parallel computation.
A second component of our
effort concerns the modeling and numerical investigation of a variety
of questions in materials science, interface motion, and nonlinear
optics.
The third component of the CMCL
involves the mathematical analysis of the phenomenology of nonlinear
conservation laws and incompressible flow.


People
 The research personnel of the CMCL consists of 7 faculty members,
9 graduate students, and several postdoctoral fellows. 
The current members include:
