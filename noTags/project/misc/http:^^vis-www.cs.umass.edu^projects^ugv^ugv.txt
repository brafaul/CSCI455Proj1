UMASS UGV Introduction

The UMass Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Project


Project Overview:

The UMass Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) project is part of the larger
ARPA-sponsored UGV effort. From
the spring of 1991 to the spring of 1994, UMass' role in the UGV
program was to develop the Mobile Perception Laboratory (MPL), a
NAVLAB-like vehicle designed to support research at UMass and elsewhere
on landmark-based navigation, motion &
stereo-based obstacle avoidance,
and 3D map construction. The MPL was completed and turned over to TACOM
in May of 1994.

Currently, the UMass UGV team is looking to contribute to ARPA's UGV
program with research in terrain reconstruction, stealth navigation behaviors
and RSTA.
