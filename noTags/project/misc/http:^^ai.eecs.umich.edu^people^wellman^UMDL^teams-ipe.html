Mission Statement

The main responsibilities of this subgroup are 

to provide mechanisms for providing access and managing licenses to use intellectual
property in the digital library, and 
to design and implement facilities for economic 
allocation of resources, including

documents in the collections,
information services, and
computation (processing, storage, and transport).


In designing these mechanisms, we seek to maximize the value accruing to 
both providers and consumers participating in the UMDL. Our approach will 
be to provide an environment whereby the participants engage in 
transactions they deem mutually beneficial.  This will include a general 
framework for negotiation of terms and delivery of information services, as 
well as a suite of specific protocols implementing some standard forms of 
agreement.  We will evaluate alternate mechanisms according to allocation 
efficiency, equity, and computational and other transaction costs.
