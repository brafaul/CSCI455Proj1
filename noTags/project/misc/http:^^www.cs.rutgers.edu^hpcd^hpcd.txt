The Hypercomputing and Design Project
The Hypercomputing and Design Project





The Web pages for HPCD are under construction 


OVERVIEW
The broad objective of HPCD is to build on top of advances
in massively parallel computing (hypercomputing), in computational
science, in AI, and in modeling/simulation technology, and to develop
a new generation of engineering automation technology that can bring
about dramatic gains in productivity of the national industrial base.
The top-level goal is to develop hypercomputing methods for attaining
order-of-magnitude speedups in the time required for transition from
an innovative design concept, or/and a scientific advance, to a useful
high-quality product. The focus of the effort is on design of complex
engineering systems (such as computers, ships, jet engines), where the
design process is strongly dependent upon the use of knowledge from
several scientific disciplines. The main technical goals of the
project are as follows:  

To develop methods that use hypercomputing power, in conjunction
with scientific knowledge in a domain, AI, and Visiometric techniques,
in order to build computational models (and related simulations) in
the domain that range from the highly accurate, but costly, models
needed for scientific discovery and design verification to the greatly
reduced and approximate, but cheap, models needed to explore large
spaces of design alternatives.
To develop methods and tools, based on AI and other related areas
of computer and computational science, to help in the setup and
control of complex simulations and the automatic analysis and
interpretation of massive datasets produced from simulation runs.
To develop methods and tools that use computational models
efficiently to manage/control the formulation and solution of complex
design problems.   


HPCD is an
ARPA/ITO
sponsored project.  Within the framework of the national HPCC program,
the project is intended as a major step towards building a
comprehensive national resource for HPC-based computational methods
and facilities that can address the 'grand challenge' of design.


The project is organized as a large scale, multidisciplinary,
multi-institutional, consortium involving researchers from academia
and industry. Participating universities include 
Rutgers,
USC
and
Princeton.
At present, industrial participants include
SAIC,
Cambridge Hydrodynamics Inc. (CHI),
GE,
Lockheed, AeroHydro,
IBM,
AMD, Sematech,
Bellcore,
UTRC, Boeing, Schlumberger, and
INTEL.
Other research collaborations have been established with researchers
from several government and industrial labs.  The Principal Investigator and Co-PI's are:

Saul Amarel (Rutgers), PI & Project Director
Louis Steinberg (Rutgers), co-PI & Assoc Proj Dir
Alvin Despain (USC), co-PI & Proj co-Dir
Steven Orszag (Princeton), co-Pi & Proj co-Dir
Eytan Barouch (CHI), co-PI
James Flanagan (Rutgers), co-PI
Apostolos Gerasoulis (Rutgers), co-PI
Doyle Knight (Rutgers), co-PI
Norman Zabusky (Rutgers), co-PI


The component efforts of HPCD are designed to address the three main
technical goals of the project, by proceeding 'bottom-up' via
exploration of selected concrete design problems, and by developing
methodologies and tools in a manner which is strongly influenced by
the 'pull' of these problems. To achieve cohesion in the overall
res-arch effort, the component efforts are organized in two main
clusters: Cluster I concentrating on design and manufacturing of
computers and of related microstructures; and Cluster II concentrating
on design tasks that are critically dependent on Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD). There is also a third supporting cluster of core work,
Cluster III,  whose emphasis is on computer/computational science
foundations and methodologies that are related to work in the 
two main clusters. Each cluster includes efforts in two or three
research areas. Collaboration among researchers, and synergy among
component efforts, are an integral part of the approach in the
project.
