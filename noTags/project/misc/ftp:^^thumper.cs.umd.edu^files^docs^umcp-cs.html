SOFTWARE INTERCONNECTION LABORATORY


The Software Interconnection Laboratory at the

University of Maryland Computer Science Department
deals with all aspects of configuration, integration and connection of
software packages and components.  The 

team members  working within this
lab specifically focus on use and
reuse of mixed-platform software in heterogeneous distributed systems.
Various 
tech reports and manuals 
concerning research activities within the laboratory are available,
with the hope that readers on the net will feel free to comment and become
involved in our work.
