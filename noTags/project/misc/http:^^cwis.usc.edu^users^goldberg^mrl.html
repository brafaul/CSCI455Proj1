Ken Goldberg, Director.

In the Modular Robotics Lab, our aim is to
develop a science base for automated assembly
lines.  We develop geometric algorithms and interactive systems that
analyze the low-level geometry of components such as part feeders,
sorters, and fixtures.  An underlying theme is the use of modular
sensors and actuators such as light beams and parallel-jaw grippers.
Although this hardware bears a close resemblance to existing `hard'
automation systems, we are applying computational theory to rapidly
configure and reliably control this hardware.  At a higher level,
modular components such as flexible feeders and conveyor belts can be
interactively configured to facilitate the design and evaluation of
assembly lines prior to installation.  The research addresses basic
theoretical questions such as the complexity and completeness of
algorithms and involves several companies in efforts to transfer basic
results into industrial practice.  The MRL is primarily funded by the
National Science Foundation and Adept Technology Inc.
