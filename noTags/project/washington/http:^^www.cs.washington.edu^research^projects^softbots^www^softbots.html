The Internet Softbot




Internet Softbot



The Softbot was one of the  5
finalists  in the 1995  Discover
Awards for Technological Innovation in Computer Software.




 Building autonomous agents that interact with real-world software
environments such as operating systems or databases is a pragmatically
convenient yet intellectually challenging substrate for AI research.
To support this claim, we are utilizing planning and machine-learning
techniques to develop an Internet softbot (software robot), a
customizable and (moderately) intelligent assistant for Internet
access.  The softbot accepts goals in a high-level language, generates
and executes plans to achieve these goals, and learns from its
experience.  The softbot enables a human user to state  what 
he or she wants accomplished. The softbot disambiguates the request
and dynamically determines  how  and  where  to satisfy
it.  The softbot uses a UNIX shell and the World-Wide Web to interact
with a wide range of internet resources.

graphical user interface.

MetaCrawler Softbot --- a fielded Web service that enables you to
search multiple Web Indices in parallel, and provides sophisticated
pruning options.  Try it!
