The OPAL Operating System Project



Opal
 

The Opal project is exploring a new operating system structure, tuned
to the needs of complex applications, such as CAD/CAM, where a number
of cooperating programs manipulate a large shared persistent database
of objects.  In Opal, all code and data exists with in a single, huge,
shared address space.  The single address space enhances sharing and
cooperation, because addresses have a unique (for all time)
interpretation.  Thus, pointer-based data structures can be directly
communicated and shared between programs at any time, and can be
stored directly on secondary storage without the need for translation.
This structure is simplified by the availability of a large address
space, such as those provided by the DEC Alpha, MIPS R4000,
HP/PA-RISC, and IBM RS6000.


Protection in Opal is independent of the single address space;
each Opal thread executes within a protection domain
that defines which virtual pages it has the right to access.
The rights to access a page can be easily transmitted from one
process to another.  The result is a much more flexible protection
structure,  permitting different (and dynamically changing)
protection options depending on the trust relationship
between cooperating parties.  We believe that this organization can
improve both the structure and performance of complex, cooperating
applications.


An Opal prototype has been built for the DEC Alpha platform on top of
the Mach operating system.
