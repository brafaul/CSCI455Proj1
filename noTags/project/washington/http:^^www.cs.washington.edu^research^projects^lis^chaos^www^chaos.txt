  Chaotic People

All sorts of  people work on the Chaotic Routing project.



   Research Papers and Technical Reports 

A repository of all of the research papers
and technical reports  of the Chaotic
Routing project is available.

  Chaos Router Chip 

The 
Chaos Router Chip  is an implementation of the chaos routing algorithm in hardware.  It 
has been built and tested in 1.2 micron CMOS, and redesigned in a 0.8 micron process for 
better performance.

  Simulator 

The 
Chaos Router Simulator  is a powerful simulator which can simulate all
sorts of networks and routing algorithms.  It includes a very nice  graphical
front end!


  Standards for Presentation of Results 

At  PCRCW '94,  we discussed the presentation
of simulation results for routing algorithms.  We were able to come up
with some  guidelines
 for presentation of results.

  Other Research Groups 

We're building a list of all  research groups  that
have webs describing research in routing and/or interconnection networks.

  Parallel Computer Routing and Communication Workshop (PCRCW) '94 

PCRCW '94 was held at the Univeristy of Washington in Seattle in May
1994.  Proceedings are available now.
