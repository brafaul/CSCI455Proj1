  Cornell Modeling and Simulation Project 
 Enormous effort is currently expended in creating scientific
software, particularly for simulating physical systems defined on
complex geometries, and when using advanced computing hardware.  The
goal of the SimLab project is to reduce this effort by bringing
together technologies such as geometric modeling, symbolic
mathematics, numerical analysis, compilation/code generation, and
formal methods to create tools that raise the semantic level
at which it is possible to create scientific software.



  Overview of the Project 
  The SimLab Software
Package 
 Selected Research Activities: 

  Collaborative Mathematics Environments, a research proposal [a postscript version]
 
Guaranteed-Quality Mesh Generation 
  Microstorage
Architecture 
  The Weyl computer
algebra substrate 
  SPL, a high-level
programming language for synthesizing scientific software 
 The
Chains Algebraic-Topological Programming Language 

Selected Presentations:

  The SimLab Component of the
ARPA/NIST MADEFAST Collaborative Design and Manufacturing Exercise.
 [longer version] 
  New Directions in
Systems Research.  Richard Zippel's presentation on some new ideas
on how systems research should proceed.  Includes brief discussions of
non-contemporaneous communications, microstorage architecture, and the
use of program transformations.

  The Chains
Programming Language.  A language for computing with ``complex
topological systems,'' such as engineering models, numerical
algorithms, etc.  Rick Palmer.
