Overview
  Prema is a runtime support system for parallel compilers and
problem solving environments that target scientific computing
applications. Prema is build on top of  PORTS (Cornell implementation)   and is designed to run on a variety of MPP and SMP computers. PREMA suppots: 

 global address space memory model 
 data and task parallel programming models 
  multi-threaded style of execution 
 
     automatic work-sharing mechanism (dynamic load balancing) 



 Papers 
  
Multithreaded model for dynamic load balancing parallel adaptive PDE
computations.  Nikos P. Chrisochoides, CTC95TR221,
Journal of Applied Numerical Mathematics 6(1996) pp 1--17, 1996.
