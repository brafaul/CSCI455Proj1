 QMG project 


 QMG: mesh generation and related software 

The QMG package does finite element mesh generation in two and three
dimensions.  The package includes geometric modeling software, the
mesh generator itself, and a finite element solver.  It is free software
downloadable from the Web.  QMG1.1 runs under Unix and Windows NT.


There are now two releases of QMG:

QMG1.0, released 5 May 1995, and
QMG1.1, released 20 November 1996.



Other useful websites for mesh generation and geometric software 
are:

mesh generation home page.

finite element resources on the Web.

software for computational
geometry.

Jonathan Shewchuk's 
Triangle package.
