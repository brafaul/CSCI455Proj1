Cachet Related Project: Efficient Incremental Computation


Deriving Incremental Programs

A general systematic transformational approach to improving the efficiency 
of computation.

Theme

Program analysis and transformations for  incrementalization .

Cachet 

An incremental-attribution-based interactive system that uses
systematic program analysis and transformation techniques to derive
incremental programs written in a functional language.
