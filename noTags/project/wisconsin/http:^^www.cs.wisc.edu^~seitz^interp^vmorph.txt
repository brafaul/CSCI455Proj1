Image morphing techniques can generate compelling 2D transitions between
images.  However, differences in object pose or viewpoint often cause
unnatural distortions in image morphs that are difficult to correct manually.
Using basic principles of projective
geometry, this paper introduces a simple extension to image morphing
that correctly handles 3D projective camera and scene transformations.
The technique, called {\em view morphing}, works by prewarping two images
prior to computing a morph and then postwarping the interpolated images.
Because no knowledge of 3D shape is required, the technique may be applied
to photographs and drawings, as well as rendered scenes.
The ability to synthesize changes both in viewpoint and image structure
affords a wide variety of interesting 3D effects via simple image
transformations.

 View morphing between two images of an object taken from 
	two different viewpoints produces the illusion of physically moving a 
	virtual camera.

  Morph between views of different faces produces simultaneous
