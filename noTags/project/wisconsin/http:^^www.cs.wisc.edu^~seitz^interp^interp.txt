Steve Seitz's View Interpolations


 View Synthesis by Image Interpolation 

Investigators:
Steve Seitz,

We have devised a provably-correct automated technique for creating new 
views of a scene from two basis views of the same scene.  The technique 
relies on geometric image interpolation, known as "morphing" in the graphics
community, to produce intermediate images.  Although morphing techniques
currently enjoy widespread use, their theoretical validity
has not been established.  In particular, does 2D interpolation of two views
of the same scene produce a sequence of physically valid in-between views of
that scene?
Surprisingly, the answer is yes, providing the images first undergo a simple
rectification procedure and certain assumptions about visibility and the
projection process are satisfied.
The view synthesis work described here uses automated stereo techniques to
determine image correspondences.  Our more recent work on 
 View Morphing 
considers how user-interaction may be used to guide the interpolation.


Below are computed interpolations for three different image pairs.  The
rectified original images are shown at left and right.  Click on the
interpolated images (center) to see mpeg movies (~50K) showing the computed
interpolations.
