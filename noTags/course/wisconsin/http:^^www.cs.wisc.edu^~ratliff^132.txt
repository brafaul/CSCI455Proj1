 You can do a keyword search of my 132 mail messages.  For example, enter "functions" below (without the quotes) to get every paragraph that used the word "functions."  You can also use * for a wildcard.

Getting software from the net:
If you have a computer at home, you might be interested in trying
some of the shareware and freeware software available from Internet 
archives.  These programs are usually compressed, and you may need some
compression or archiving software to "unpack" them. You may need to review
some DOS commands before trying this. One of the biggest 
and best maintained archives is Simtel, so I'm
including some links to Simtel FAQ files posted on Usenet:
