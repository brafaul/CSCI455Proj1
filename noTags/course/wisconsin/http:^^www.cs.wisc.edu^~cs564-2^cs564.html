CS564 Lecture 2 Home Page


 Welcome to the home page for CS564-2.  This page is (obviously)
under construction; as the semester progresses we will be adding
information that you need to know to this page.

 The most important thing to know now is that the class meeting
room has been changed.  Currently we are meeting in 150 Russell Labs
for the TR lectures; the optional discussion on Friday has not been
moved so it is still in 103 Psychology.

More information. 
	This lecture of 564 will be taught in close cooperation
        with Lecture 1; in fact, the assignments (but probably not the
        exams) will be the same for both.  For more information about
        CS564 in general, and the Minibase assignments in particular,
        please see the CS564 Lecture 1 Homepage .
