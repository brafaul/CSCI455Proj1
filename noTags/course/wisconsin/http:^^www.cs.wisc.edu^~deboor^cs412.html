analysis algorithms, I have posted a 
 preprint, by one of the foremost
mathematicians of today, on that subject, for those interested in this tricky
topic.

The text is brand new:  Introduction to Scientific Computing , by C.
Van Loan (Computer Science Department, Cornell University), Prentice-Hall,
hence there is a growing
 list of errata for the text; also the text
may be supplemented here and there by
additional material  (12sep, 19sep,
24sep, 26sep, 01oct, 08oct, 10oct, 15oct,  17oct, 29oct).
All the  m-files mentioned in the book are
available, organized by chapter. Be aware, though, that, on the 
 ftp site 
mentioned in the book as well as here, all their names begin with a capital
letter while, sometimes, their name in the book begins with lower case
letter.

 Present plans are to have all computing assignments in MATLAB (rather 
than Fortran or C).
   Kermit Sigmon's MATLAB Primer, 3rd Edition, is available at DoIT, for
