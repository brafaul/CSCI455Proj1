 CS 540 - Intro to AI (Kunen's Section) 


 CS 540 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
 Notice 
The information here is for Spring, 1997.
Further details about the course
will appear here later.



 Instructor: 
Ken Kunen

Office:       6385 CS & Stats Building
Telephone:    263-2874
Email:        kunen@cs.wisc.edu
Office Hours: ????, or by appointment, or by email.

 Grades 
There will be four programming assignments, counting 10%
each, and three exams, counting 20% each; the third
exam will be at the scheduled time and place for the final.
Programs may be turned in any time (until midnight) on the
day due.
Late assignments will loose 5% for each day late.


 Topics Covered 
The following order of topics isn't entirely logical, but
is designed so that the topic for each programming assignment
is discussed before the program is due.


 Introduction to Lisp (Program 1)
 Searching and Game Playing (Program 2)
 Introduction to Prolog
 Natural Language Understanding (Program 3)
 Learning and Neural Networks (Program 4)
 Logical Deduction
 Planning 
 Reasoning with Uncertain Knowledge

 Lisp Information 
Since Lisp is used in a lot (not all!) of AI programming, the course
will begin with a discussion of COMMON Lisp.  It would probably be useful
to have some Lisp reference available to supplement the lectures
and the on-line help available within lisp itself.  There are many
paperbacks available, most of which are probably ok.
 
  I like Common LISPcraft by Wilensky.
   Another possibility: 
      The ANSI Common Lisp Book by Graham.
       
       Code used in the book is on line.
 The Ultimate Lisp Reference: Steele's Common
        Lisp: The Language (2nd Edition) , 1029 pages.  Also
      
         available on line.

 Additional Information

 Textbook: 
Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
       by Russell and Norvig
   Class time: 8:30 - 10:45 TR (Lec. 1) and 11:00 - 12:15 TR (Lec. 2)
      in 1325 CS.
   Recitation sessions:  2:30 - 3:45 T
      in 2305 Engr (Lec. 1) and 4:00 - 5:15 T in 121 Psych (Lec. 2).
      In these, no essentiallly new material will be presented.
       I'll answer questions, give hints for
       programming assignments, and review for exams.
       They will usually last only 50 minutes.  Since I am teaching
       both sections, you may attend a recitation section which
      is different from your lecture section.
   The course directory is /p/course/cs540-kunen/public 
   An alpha-beta problem from a previous exam is on the course
      directory (alpha_beta.ps).

   A best-first-search problem from a previous exam is on the course
      directory (astar.ps).

   Exam 1
   Exam 2
