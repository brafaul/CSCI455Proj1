Announcements:

 Program 7 is on-line and due Tues Nov 12. 
   IMPORTANT!  You need to get the 
       new version of tribble.h (as of 11/4) before you compile.  The 
       problem was that the enumerated types were not recognized outside of
       the class.  They must be declared inside the public section of the class.
       As a result, the private section at the top needed to bumped down to the
       private section at the bottom.  This is shown in the new version.
       Also note the definition of the RandomIntInRange() is
       defined in-line so that you will not need a corresponding 
       function body in tribble.cpp.  You can just call it from within the
       class, and it will work.
 In the file "prog06.cpp" I forgot to change the enumerated
     type values to uppercase.  You need to do this before you
     compile everything.  I have changed the 
     on-line copy of prog06.cpp if you just want to overwrite your
     obsolete copy.  Also, it used to say "#include prog05.h", so I changed
     it to "prog06.h"
   You might also want to check the help link below again... something
       was added.
   Here are some Comments and
       Suggestions for Program 6.  
   It is very important that you use the same name throughout
       program 6 for the project parts (name of the project, 
       directory name, file names, etc.).  I updated the program
       description to be consistent with "prog06."  If you saw
       the old version (that used "prog05"), please make sure
       you are consistent with your naming.  The only discrepency
       is with the sample run in Chris Weaver's public directory
       where it is called prog05, but this shouldn't matter for 
       your program (it is just a sample).
   Program 6 is on-line and ready.  It is crucial that you read
       the entire assignment and understand class basics before you
       attempt it, and that you get an early start.  It is not 
       hard, but will require some time to piece everything 
       together.  Bring questions to class on Tuesday!
   About midterm grades for freshmen...  you either got a B (which
     means your doing fine), or a D (which means you're not doing so
     great).  It is a thumbs up or down grade, and means nothing more
     than that.  If you're not a freshman, disregard this.
