 Homework Assignments

Homework #0: Image Enhancement by Histogram Modification (Optional)
Make a copy of your portrait image in ~cs766-1/public/images/
and then use xv to contrast enhance your face.  Do this by
first rotating the image, then cropping a window around your head
(say down to your shoulders), and finally interactively adjusting the
Intensity modification function in the Color Editor window under the
Windows button.  (You are also free to modify other things such as color
if you wish.)  When you have found a good grayscale transformation
save the result as a color gif image and
put it in the same directory where
the original image is.  Send me email telling me qualitatively what
intensity transformation you applied and why it improves the quality
of the image overall.  I'll then use this image in the "photo board"
of students in the class.  Feel free to use this image in your own
Web home page as well!

Homework #1: Skeletons (Due: October 3)
  
Learn about getting started with
    the Vista vision software
Read the Introduction to Vista Programming manual
    that is available at DOIT Documentation
    Corrections to the Original Assignment
      
In Method 1, change condition 1 to be "at least 3 ..."
	instead of "at least 2 ...";  this will prevent some
	types of shapes from disappearing altogether
	In Method 1, condition 2 should also count as a 0-1 transition
	the case where NW=0 and N=1
	In Method 2, the 3 x 3 matrix c for city-block distance should have
	infinity (i.e., some large constant), not 0, in the four corners
	In Method 2, the 3 x 3 matrix c for chessboard distance should have
	0, not 1, in the center position
      
TEST IMAGES to be used:
    (1) /p/vision/images/hw1/DOIT.v
    (2) /p/vision/images/hw1/hand.v
To evaluate your thinning results, you might want to
    try the following additional experiment using the output of at least
    one of your tests:  (1) Convert your skeleton image to ubyte format using
    vconvert, (2) edit (you may need to use Emacs because vi is
    not "8-bit clean") the header of the new
    image file so that it contains the following lines right after the
    repn: ubyte line:
	component_interp: gradient
	low_threshold: 1
	high_threshold: 2
    (3) run vlink on this file, and then (4) vsegedges.  
    Try using the results on the image hand.v, for example, to
    see how well this approach might be used to determine the direction
    the index finger is pointing (for a HCI application, say).
    Note:  The thinning method may in fact delete entirely some shapes;
    e.g., a 2 x 2 block of 1's surrounded by all 0's will disappear
    The thinning algorithm is based on the papers: (1) T. Zhang and C. Suen,
    A fast parallel algorithm for thinning digital patterns,
    Comm. ACM 27(3), 1984, 236-239, and
    (2) H. Lu and P. Wang, A comment on "a fast parallel algorithm
    for thinning digital patterns," Comm. ACM 29(3),
    1986, 239-242.
    Comparison of student results of the
    different methods applied to the pointing hand image and a
    rotated version of this test image
  

Homework #2: Image Splining for Mosaics (Due: October 24)
  
Read the 3 papers:
    
E. H. Adelson et al., Pyramid methods in image processing,
        RCA Engineer 29-6, Nov/Dec 1984
      P. Burt and E. H. Adelson, The Laplacian pyramid as a compact
        image code, IEEE Trans. Comm. 31, 1983, 532-540
      P. Burt and E. H. Adelson, A multiresolution spline
        with application to image mosaics, ACM Trans. Graphics
2, 1983, 217-236
      
Hints and FAQs
Some splined images
	produced by students in the class
  

Homework #3: Segmentation by Snakes (Due: November 9)
  
Read the 2 papers:
      
M. Kass, A. Witkin and D. Terzopoulos,
      Snakes: Active contour models,
      Int. J. Computer Vision 1,
      1988, 321-331
      D. Williams and M. Shah, A fast algorithm for active contours
      and curvature estimation, Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image
      Processing: Image Understanding 55, 1992, 14-26
      
Hints and FAQs


Homework #4: Your Own Project (Due: December 18)
  
 Student Project Titles and Abstracts
 See Supplementary Readings
    for some additional papers that might help you select a topic. 
     Student projects done in Stanford vision course



 Computer Accounts

Accounts
    Course accounts are on the Sun Sparcstations called sun1 - sun36
    in rooms 1358, 1363 and 1368.  Each account has a large disk space quota
    of 50MB so you can store images for homeworks and
    your project.  Be sure to delete old images and compress others
    (see gzip(1)), however,
    in order to save space.  
    Email
    Email sent to cs766-1list
    goes to everyone in the class including the instructor and TA
    Printers
    To print images you should use one of the laserprinters,
    laser1 - laser4, which are located
    in room 1359.  Alternatively, the generic printer name laser will
    send output to one of the four printers with the shortest queue.  Caution:
    Before sending images to the printer, be sure to check the queue;  if
    there are a lot of jobs being printed it is bad manners to send images
    to be printed because they take so long to print.  Be considerate!
Vision Software

 Vista
        The Vista
	programming environment will be used in the homework assignments.
	The code is located in the directory /p/vision/ip-tools/vista/
	Man pages are in /p/vision/ip-tools/vista/man/
	and executables are in /p/vision/ip-tools/vista/bin/
 Xv
xv(1) is an interactive image display program for the X
	window system that is very useful for displaying images in a
	variety of formats.  

	 ImgStar
	70 basic image processing operations invoked using Unix-like command lines.
	Code, executables and manual are in /p/vision/ip-tools/imgstar/
 Khoros
	The Khoros image processing software development environment 
	provides a set of basic image processing modules and a graphical
	programming language interface for rapid prototyping of simple
	image processing algorithms.  The code is located in the directory
	/p/vision/ip-tools/khoros /p/vision/ip-tools/khoros/bin/cantata
	is the executable that starts up the interactive environment.  

	 Netpbm
	A toolkit for conversion of images between a large variety of
	different formats.  Based on the Pbmplus package.  Man pages are in
	/p/vision/ip-tools/man/ and executables are in 
	/p/vision/ip-tools/bin/
 Matlab
Matlab(1) is a numeric computation and visualization
	environment.  Signal processing
	and image processing toolboxes are especially relevant.
      
Test Images
      Most test images will be put in the directory
      /p/vision/images/ although they may require format
      conversion to be used.  Some other images may be put in
      ~cs766-1/public/images/  Numerous image databases are also
      accessible via the WWW; for example, see the
      collection of test images at CMU


 Examination

Examination
Solution
 The Exam will be held on Thursday, November 16 from 12:45 pm to 2:15 pm in the regular classroom, 1325 CS.  Note the early
  starting time!   The exam will cover topics up through shape-from-shading,
  including readings in the textbook, papers sold through DOIT, and
  homework assignments.  You may bring into the exam one (1) 8.5" x 11"
  sheet of paper with any notes you want on both sides.  The exam will
  focus on main ideas and algorithms, not proofs.  See old exams below for
  the types of questions that will be asked.
