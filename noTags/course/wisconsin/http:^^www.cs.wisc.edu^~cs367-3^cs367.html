Course Objectives
CS367 has two objectives:

Present the concepts of data structures in general and some of the most widely used structures in detail. Data structures are the fundamental building 
blocks of computer programs. By the end of the course, you should be able to identify situations in which a data structure is necessary, determine the 
requirements for the data structure, and select the appropriate data structure from those covered in this course.
Reiterate the concepts of structure programming, abstract data types, and modularity. These principles, which were introduced in CS302, are essential 
to writing clear, correct, and maintainable software. As there is a close connection between abstract data types and data structures, this course places 
a strong emphasis on applying these principles in all programming exercises.

Teaching Assistants
Wei Zhang and Chin Tang Chin are the teaching assistants (TAs) for
this course (sections 2 and 3). They will grade your homework assignments
and will be happy to answer questions about the
assignments, or any other aspect of the course that is giving you trouble.

Text
The text book for this course is Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors by Frank M. Carrano (ISBN # 0-8053-1226-9). 
This is a well-written, if a little long-winded, text that covers most (but not all) of the material in this course. It also includes background about C++, so a 
separate text for the language is not necessary.
The lectures will often (but not always) follow David Dewitt's CS 367 Lecture Notes - Fall 1995. These notes are far more complete that simple lecture 
notes, but they fall short of a true text book (they contain very little narrative text, no exercises, etc.). I am using these notes as a basis for my lectures; as 
such, I feel free to skip portions and cover additional material. You may want to purchase these notes, which are available from the DoIT documentation 
desk at the Dayton Street entrance of the Computer Sciences building (1210 W. Dayton St). 
If this course is your first experience with Unix, you will need information about activating your account, logging in, creating, editing, and manipulating files, 
and compiling, running, and debugging programs. The handout CS 1000, also available from the DoIT information desk, contains this crucial information. 
(Also, see also the help section below.)
Lecture Information 
Tuesday and Thursday: 11:00 - 12:30 in 107 Psychology.
As mentioned above, lectures will often follow DeWitt's notes. Lecture attendence is strongly recommended as I will regularly present material that does not 
appear in the textbook or lecture notes, but will be useful for the programming assignments and exams. Needless to say, You are responsible for all 
material covered in lecture! The exams will be based on the lecture material, reading assignments in the notes, and the course assignments.
Electronic Mail
I often use electronic mail to notify students of changes in assignments, hints for programs, etc. I assume that you regularly read your electronic mail.
Grading
There will be one or two evening exams during the semester, a final exam and five programming assignments. The exams will determine 50% of the final 
grade (with approximately equal weight for each one), and the programming assignments will count for 10% each.
The C++ Language 
CS 367 will be taught using the C++ programming language, and programming assignments must be written in C++. If you do not know C++, you should 
not be in this section of CS367. Jim Skrentny is teaching two sections of CS367 that cover C++ in addition to data structures. C++ is a large and complex 
language; unless you are an experience programming (and even then), it is a difficult language to learn from a book.
There is also another WWW page with more information on the programming assignments.
Gdb
There is also a web page that describes the gdb program debugger.

Assignment 0
This is an absolute requirement to get a grade other than F! Turn in an index card with the following information:

Name and login name
Year in school (freshman, sophomore, ...)
Previous CS courses
Previous programming experience
Recent photograph of you. It should not be your picture from your 1st birthday, nor from that boy/girl scout trip in the summer of 1984. It can be 
color or black-and-white, any size, etc. No CS367 grades will be given without a photo! 

Assignment 1
The first programming assignment is to write a simple abstract data byte for
a bounded integer sequence.  The text of the assignment is 
on-line.

Assignment 2
The second programming assignment is to write a program to maintain a database
of scores for a tennis tournament.  The text of the assignment is 
on-line.

Assignment 3
The second programming assignment is to write a program to produce a
concordance using hash tables.  The text of the assignment is 
on-line.
