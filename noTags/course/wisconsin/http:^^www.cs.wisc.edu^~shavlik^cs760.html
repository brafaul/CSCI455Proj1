  BRR Assignments 

 BRR #3: on the ML journal article by Towell & Shavlik on the KBANN algorithm.
       Due Monday, May 6, 1996
   BRR #2: on the ML journal article by Fisher on the COBWEB algorithm.
       Due Wednesday, April 17, 1996
   BRR #1: on the ML journal article by Shavlik, Mooney, & Towell that 
       empirically compares ID3 and backprop.
       Due Wednesday, March 20, 1996
   Be sure to answer (on one sheet of paper):
        
 Best Idea and Why?
            What to do Next and How?
       
       Do not summarize the assigned paper (one-sentence summary as a lead-in is ok);
       instead analyze it.
   Late policy on BRRs: 50% off if handed in after material covered in lecture.
 
  Homework Assignments 

 
	Homework 4: Learning from Reinforcements - Q-Learning 
        Due Wednesday, April 10, 1996
   
	Homework 3: Training Neural Networks - BP 
        Due Monday, March 25, 1996
   
	Homework 2: Experimental Methodology
        Due Monday, February 26, 1996
   
	Homework 1: Inducing Decision Trees - ID3
        Due Monday, February 12, 1996
   
	Homework 0: Creating Your Personal Concept
        Due Monday, January 29, 1996
   Late policy on HWs: 
      
 HWs are due at the start of class.
         Each student will have FIVE "free" late days for use
             over the semester.  Once these are exhausted, there will be
             a penalty of 10% per day (measured noon-to-noon; weekends are free).
         To make the TA's job tractable, no HWs will be accepted more than
             one week late.
