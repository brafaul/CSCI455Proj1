  Once you set up your class account, NEVER LEAVE YOUR
  COMPUTER WITHOUT EXITING FROM WINDOWS.  When you exit from
  windows, you automatically exit from your account, too.  If you don't
  do as instructed, the next person starting using the computer
  you've just abandoned has complete control over your account.
  They can send messages signed with your name, read your mail, copy, or even
  delete your personal work.  Remember to exit windows when you're
  done working for the day, or when you plan to leave your machine
  unattended for some time.
 
  The email address you get when you initialize your account is
  provided to you by the Computer Sciences department and is
  different from the one provided by DoIT.  You will have the account
  for CS 132 only during this semester; after the end of the course the
  account will be canceled.  As long as you are a UW student, the email 
  account that DoIT provides will be active.  Look for messages and
  announcements for CS 132 in your Computer Sciences account.
