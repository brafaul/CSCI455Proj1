Important Announcements

I have extended the deadline for Program 6
.  Please check your e-mail or read the
NEW PROGRAM 6 DEADLINE INFORMATION

Midterm 2 is on Tuesday, November 12th, from 
7:15-9:15pm in Comp Sci & Stat 1325 again.

Current grades are on-line.  This 
includes grades for everything handed in through Tuesday, November 5th.

Sample programs:  I've taken some of my examples from the past
few weeks of class and filled in all the stuff I glossed over to make
fully functioning programs out of them.  You may find this useful if
you missed a day or even if you were there and didn't understand an example.
They're on the notes and examples page,
near the bottom.

Remember to check your e-mail for clarifications to the programming
assignments.
