Course Introduction:
This class is designed to take you from zero knowledge of computers
to being a crack shot user (and using these skills to get yourself through
college and into the job arena!). Our lab sections are taught using Macintosh
computers, but sections using PCs are available (see CS132
Using Computers - Lectures 1 &2).
The course has two components:
Part 1 - Lecture:
In the lecture we will discuss computers in "generic" terms,
i.e. general computer science topics. We will discuss how computers work,
including the following topics (not necessarily in this order):

application programs (including word processors, spreadsheets, graphics
  and databases) 
hardware, input/output, storage devices 
operating systems, programming languages 
networks and telecommunications 
artificial intelligence and expert systems 
computer-related social issues 

Part 2 - Lab:
In the laboratory (discussion) sections you will have hands-on experience
on Macintosh IIci computers with the following programs:

word processing (MS Word 5.0) 
electronic mail, newsgroups, and World Wide Web (Eudora 3.0 and
  Netscape 3.0) 
painting and drawing (Aldus SuperPaint 3.0) 
spreadsheet and charting (MS Excel 5.0) 
database (FileMaker) 
presentation manager (HyperCard 2.1) 
desktop publishing (Aldus PageMaker 4.0) 

An integral part of lab is learning the Macintosh operating system (System
7.5.3) as well.
In addition, there are some special tools (CD-ROM and scanners) available.
There are 10 TAs that teach the lab sections. Both the TAs and I have the
goal of providing you with high quality instruction and a rich educational
experience.
