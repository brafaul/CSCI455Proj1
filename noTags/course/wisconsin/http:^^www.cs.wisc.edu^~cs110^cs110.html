CS 110


Introduction to Computer Programming 
Computer Sciences 110 
Fall 1996

This is a one-credit course designed to cover the basic programming
structures needed to prepare the students for CS310 and elementary
engineering courses.  The material covered will be sufficient to enable
the student to write simple programs to solve engineering problems in
elementary courses.


The material in CS 110 is essentially the same as the first half of CS 302.
