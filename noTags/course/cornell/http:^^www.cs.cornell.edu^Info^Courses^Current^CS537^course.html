 Course
Description 
CS 537 is being offered for the first time in Fall 1996. It is intended
to give students a solid background in the design and development of database
management systems (DBMS's). Database systems are possibly the world's
largest pieces of software, and certainly among the most valuable pieces
of software. While a DBMS is in one sense a giant application program,
there are surprisingly many principles behind its development and use.
The database industry is growing and thriving, and the demand for knowledgeable
database engineers is much greater than the supply. The database research
community is also active, and there are always new problems to be addressed
because of the explosive amounts of data that people wish to access. This
course forms essential background for anyone who wants to (a) become a
systems engineer at a database development company, or (b) become an informed
user of database systems, or (c) become a database systems researcher,
or (d) develop systems in any domain that manipulate large amounts of data,
or (e) find out how a teller machine really works! 
A number of "advanced fundamental" DBMS concepts will be covered.
Although this is not intended to be an introductory course, it is a new
course and there may be students in the class with different backgrounds.
Consequently, the discussion of various topics will begin with a quick
review of basic material taught in CS 432. Click here
for a tentative list of topics to be covered. 
In terms of workload, here's what the course involves: 

There will be a midterm and a final examination. These will test a
breadth of basic concepts. 
Each student will have to do a survey paper on a specific advanced
topic. Here is a list of possible topics. The
purpose of this is to be aware that what is being taught in the course
is only a fraction of what is out there. This paper will be due three weeks
after the midterm, and should be complete with references. It will require
reading papers from journals and conference proceedings in the engineering
library. I will suggest initial references, and you will have to pursue
additional references from there. Click here for
information on reference material in the library. 
A development project involving C++ programming. Look here
for more information. 
There will be no written homework assignments. 
Students take turns writing lecture notes. Depending on enrollment,
this means each person will have to take notes once or twice in the semester.
Hopefully, this additional work will turn out to be useful around exam
time. Here are the details (in .ps).




 Development
Project 
The term project is an important part of the course, and will involve
a significant amount of C++ programming. You can choose whether you wish
to work alone or in teams of two. However, the two-person projects will
involve proportionally more work. The goal of the project is two-fold:
(a) to get hands-on experience at building some specific DBMS component,
(b) to get comfortable working with a large pre-existing code-base, and
modifying it in a modular manner. The second goal is as important as the
first one, because all database systems are huge software systems, and
rarely do you have the luxury of starting from scratch. This forces you
to write modular code, and also to understand the interaction between the
different system components when the inevitable bugs appear. 
There are two research DBMS prototypes that will be used in the projects.
One is MINIBASE, which is software associated with the textbook. It is
a simple single-user database system that provides all the components from
the SQL parser down to the disk manager. This should hopefully be available,
depending on our being able to compile and run it in our computing environment.
The important part of MINIBASE is the interface description of the various
system components. The actual code comes from class projects. Consequently,
projects using MINIBASE will involve writing a component (like the buffer
manager), based on a specification of its C++ interface. 
The other prototype is PREDATOR, which is a query processing engine
that I have been developing for my research. There are a number of possible
projects (some of which could lead to research topics) that can be built
on top of PREDATOR. The focus here is on the high-end functionality like
complex queries and new data types. 
If you are not familiar with C++, I recommend a MINIBASE project because
the amount of design needed is minimal. If you think you are interested
in database systems research, then you should do a PREDATOR project. If
you fall in neither category, then you should decide whether you want a
project at the lower-level DBMS (storage, access, buffer) areas, or the
higher-level (query processing, optimization) areas and choose between
MINIBASE (lower-level) and PREDATOR (higher-level). There are also some
general projects that involve neither system. If you have your own idea
on a suitable project, you should talk with me about it well in advance
of the project proposal date. 
Here is a tentative list of possible projects.
In all the projects, there will be certain steps that should be followed:


As part of the project proposal, you should (discuss with me) and submit
an ordered list of pieces of functionality that the project will produce.

There will be a mid-project review in which you meet with me to discuss
the progress that you have made towards completing the project. 
The code you write must follow the coding conventions of the particular
system that you are working on. A detailed coding conventions document
will be provided and should be followed closely. This is something that
I will be very picky on, and that will contribute to the grade you get
on the project. 
Project submission should include a demo and a reasonable amount of
test data.

 Course
TextBook 
The primary text is a beta edition of a new book on database systems
: "Database Management Systems" by Raghu Ramakrishnan. This book
contains many more details than are in most other introductory database
books. It is also associated with free software for an instructional database
system "MINIBASE",
which we might use in class assignments. The textbook is available in the
campus store for $46. Here are other textbooks which could be used as references:


Korth & Silberschatz: Database System Concepts. McGraw-Hill, Second
Edition, 1991. 
This is the standard introductory database text, but lacks the detail to
be used in a graduate course. 
Michael Stonebraker: Readings in Database Systems. Morgan Kaufmann,
Second Edition, 1994.
This is a collection of relatively recent papers in the area, collected
and introduced by Stonebraker, who developed the Ingres, Postgres, and
Illustra database systems. Many of these are fundamental papers on core
areas. 
Elmasri & Navathe: Fundamentals of Database Systems. Benjamin-Cummings,
Second Edition, 1994. 
This is an alternative introductory database text. 
Gray & Reuter: Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques.
Morgan Kaufmann, 1993. 
This is the bible of transaction processing, 1000 pages long, and tells
you all there is to know (and a lot more) about transactions. It is a wonderful
reference to clear up confusing aspects of concurrency control, recovery,
transaction semantics, etc. 

Some reference material has also been placed in the library. Click here

 Grading
Policies 
The grades for the course will be assigned based on the following percentages:


Prelim (mid-term) exam : 25\% 
Final exam : 25\% 
Survey paper + Lecture Notes : 15\% 
Term project : 35\% 

The prelim exam will be on the evening of Oct 10th at 7:30pm in Upson
111/111A. It will be set to be comfortably finished in 1.5 hrs, but an
extra half hour will be provided for those who need it. Likewise for the
final exam. The final should be in exam period 16 (Thurs., Dec 19 9:00-11:30am),
but this again is tentative and needs to be confirmed. The final exam will
focus on material not tested in the mid-term, but the material covered
in the earlier part of the course may form background for some of the questions.
