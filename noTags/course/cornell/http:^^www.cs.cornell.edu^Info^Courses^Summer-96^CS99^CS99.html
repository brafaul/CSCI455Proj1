Section #1: 10:00 - 11:00am in Philips 203

Thursday's class (7/11) will meet in the MacLab, as usual.
Prelim #1: The first in-class prelim will be on Wednesday, 
7/10.
It is an in-class, closed book exam, that will cover all course material
covered through the first 4 lab assignments.
Labs #3 and Lab #4 are both due on Tuesday, (7/9).  
You do not need a computer to do Lab #4.
