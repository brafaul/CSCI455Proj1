Course Description

This course will cover several central topics in the area of
databases.  These include database modeling; theory, design
and implementation of query languages; post-relational
database systems; and theory of transactions management. 


It is strongly recommended that you have had a course which covers the
principles of database systems.  Furthermore, programming experience
with C++ is expected. 

Programming assignments will involve Sybase (a relational database
management system), Coral (a deductive database programming language),
Postgres (an object-relational database management system), and Exodus
or Shore (an object-oriented storage manager).  If time permits, we
will also use ODE (an object-oriented database management system).
Information about these systems is maintained in the Database Group
homepage at http://www.cs.indiana.edu/database/DBLab.html#systems.
These database systems are maintained in the database laboratory (LH
401A) by the database lab systems assistant Sudhir Rao (srao@center).
Please contact Sudhir about technical issues related to these systems.

Assignments

The details of the assignments will be covered in the lecture. You are
encouraged to discuss the fundamental issues of each assignment with
your classmates, but we expect the work you actually hand in to be
your own. 

As the assignments are given, the hypertext version of this course
description will be updated to contain links to the assignment description. 

 Assignment 1
 Data for assignment 1
 New data for assignment 1
 Assignment 2
 Assignment 3

Communication

The course newsgroup, ac.c.646, will be
used to post announcements, such as assignments, exams, and any exceptions
to my usual office hours.  You are also encouraged to use it to post
questions related to the course or share related information with the
class.  Make a habit of looking for new notes a few times each week. 

This course description is accessible as an HTML (hypertext markup
language) file on the WWW (World Wide Web) by accessing the Computer
Science Department's home page (http://www.cs.indiana.edu/)
and following the link for C646.  It will be updated with additional
information, such as programming assignments, as the course progresses. 
Tasks and Grade Distribution

 Assignments (40%). These assignments will involve programming in post-relational database systems.
 Two exams (each worth 30%). These will be take home exams and will deal with the theoretical aspects of the course.

Policies
Academic Integrity

Read the Computer Science Department's Statement on
Academic Integrity to be sure you understand the rules under
which computer science courses operate.  Cases of academic dishonesty
will be reported to the Office of Student Ethics, a branch of the
Office of the Dean of Students.  
Withdrawal

Wednesday, October 25, is the last day (until 4 p.m.) to drop a course or
withdraw from all courses with an automatic `W'.  After that date, a
student may withdraw only with the permission of his or her dean.
This approval is normally only for urgent reasons related to
extended illness or equivalent distress.   

Wednesday, November 29, is the last day for deans to approve a course
drop.  
Incomplete grade

An incomplete (`I') final grade will be given only by prior arrangement
in exceptional circumstances conforming to university and departmental
policy which requires, among other things, that the student must have
completed the bulk of the work required for the course with a passing
grade, and that the remaining work can be made up within 30 days after
the end of the semester.
