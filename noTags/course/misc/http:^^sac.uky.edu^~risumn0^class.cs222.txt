Welcome

   NOTICE! :
2ND EXAM NOTICE 
C Example
 If you are using
the MICROLAB to enter your programs, please do the following (if you want
to avoid grief).  When you bring up your SAC account, you will notice a
menu bar at the top of you session.  One of the items is TERMINAL.  Pick
it.  This will present you with another menu.  Pick PREFERENCES.  Make
sure that your emulation is vt100 and the BUFFER SIZE is set to 24.  Most
of the lab stations default to 25 lines, and this makes for a confused
editor session.  (See, maybe you weren't crazy--it WAS vi!)
