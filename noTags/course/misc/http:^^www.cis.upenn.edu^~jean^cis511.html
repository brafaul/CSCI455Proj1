Brief description: The course provides an introduction to 
the theory of computation.  The treatment is mathematical, but the point 
of view is that of Computer Science.  Roughly speaking, the theory of 
computation consists of three overlapping subareas: (1) formal languages 
and automata; (2) computability and recursive function theory; (3) 
complexity theory.  The course will focus mostly on (1) and (2).  Applications 
of (1) to programming (and natural) language specification and 
parsing (top-down and bottom-up parsing), will be emphasized.

Topics will include:

 Basics of language theory: alphabets, strings, concatenation, 
languages, operations on languages (including Kleene *)
 Deterministic finite automata (DFA's)
 The cross-product construction
 Nondeterministic finite automata (NFA's)
