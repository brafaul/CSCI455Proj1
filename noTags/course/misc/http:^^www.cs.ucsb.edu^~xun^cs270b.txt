 Format 
	  In this class I will be presenting some of the fundmental topics that form the basis of research in Distributed Systems. The topics we will cover are in no way exhaustive, and of course, they reflect my own subjective biases. I will be using Tanenbaum's textbook as well as a short collection of papers. This combination should help expose you to both some practical and well as theoretical aspect of distributed systems. I expect you all to read the chapters and papers that I discuss in class. I strongly encourage you to come and talk to me about any distributed systems topics that are not covered in this list. I expect to hand out 5-6 homework assignments. Some of these will involve programming some of the basic ideas discussed in class. Some of the homeworks may involve reading a paper that is related to the topic being discussed in class. I have put several books on reserve in the library, some of which may provide some background material, while others complement the class.

	  


 Textbook and Notes 

  
		  Distributed Operating Systems, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Prentice Hall 1995.

		  
		  Additional papers are available at The Grafik Arts.

	  



 Policies and Exams 
	  There will be one mid-term in class on October 24 and a final exam. Requests for exam and homework regrades must be submitted within 2 weeks of their return. Finally, grades will be approximately allocated as follows: mid-term: 25%, final 35%, homeworks and projects 40%.
