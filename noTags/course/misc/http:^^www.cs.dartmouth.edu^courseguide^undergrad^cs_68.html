Prerequisite: Computer Science 23. Computer Science 25 and 37 are recommended. 
Dist: TAS 


This course provides a study of the principles of programming languages. The course will focus on the
similarities and differences among conventional, functional, logic programming, and object-oriented
languages. Topics include formal definitions of languages, control structures, methods for structuring data,
