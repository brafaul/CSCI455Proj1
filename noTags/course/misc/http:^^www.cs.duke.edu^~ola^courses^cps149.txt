  Course Overview  
From the Course Catalog

Techniques for attacking, solving, and writing computer programs for
challenging computational problems.  Algorithmic and Programming
Language toolkits.

What the course is about

The course is intended to provide practice for participation in the ACM
programming contest.  The regional contest will be held on November
16th at several sites, this year Duke is a site.  
People in CPS 149S are expected to participate in the
contest.  The top two teams in the region go to the world finals.
This year's finals will be held in San Jose, CA
on March 2, 1997.  


  Syllabus  
 

Each week three problems will be assigned.  We anticipate ten weeks
of problems (with some time off for fall break and for the regional
contest).  Thus a total of 30 problems will be assigned.  We will try to
make one of the problems each week a challenge.  The other two problems
will be easier, but still require an effort to get completely correct.


  Grading  
 
Coded solutions will be graded on a scale of 0, 2, 6, 10.  A 10 point
solution solves all input test files correctly.  A 6 point solution
solves some test files, but not all.  A 2 point solution represents an
honest effort at an attempt, but may not solve the problem for any
test data.  An honest effort is subject to interpretation, but we
anticipate that it represents at least two hours of work.
 
Problems done individually earn full credit.  For group solutions, the
points earned are split among the group members so that a perfect
solution for a two-person group earns each person 5 points.  
 
Two cut-offs have been established: 120 points earns an A, 80 points
earns a B.  We might lower these cutoffs but we will not raise them.
Each student must also make one presentation of a solution.  Failure to
present a solution will cause a 10 point deduction in total points.
 
Students participating in the regional contest can earn points for
problems solved in the contest.  We may give full credit for all
problems solved to each team member
rather than dividing credit among team members.



 Assignments 

Each assignment should include a README file with the names of all group
members (or just one name if an individual attempt) and the time it took to
complete.  Turn in only one program for each group attempt.
