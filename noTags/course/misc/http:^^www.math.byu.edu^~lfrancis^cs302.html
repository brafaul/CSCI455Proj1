CS 302: Computers in Secondary Education
Winter 1996
This course focuses on the use of computers in secondary math and computer science education.  Below you will find links to information related to the class such as the course outline, the readings, the assignments, the newsgroup, the students in the class,  and other useful sites.   

We believe that there are many advantages to using a course home page. 
Including:

  To facilitate  distribution of information without the use of paper.  
 To encourage communication between students (newsgroup). and 
To help students to become familiar with the potential of the internet. 

 Please let 
 Dr. Francis-Pelton
know if there's anything we can do to improve it.

Assignments

The regular homework for this course consists of eight assignments. The first is an ungraded course orientation assignment .  The remaining seven deal with topics discussed in class.



Readings

Each week you will be expected to read the articles provided or think about a question posed.   The readings will either be available in the reserve reading room of the HBLL or found on the WWW.  It is up to you to check this page often enough to make sure that you are up to date on the reading or question  and respond in the News Group.


Course Communication Forum 
The newsgroup for this class is byu.class.cs302.   You will need to become familiar with this method of communication, and be tolerant of it's asyncronous nature
 (ie: you may not see your posting appear immediately). 
 Your participation in this newsgroup is expected, and will contribute toward your final grade.   Full credit for this portion of the course will be given if you participate substantially in each weekly discussion.
