Important stuff

 Your grades are available for all of
the reading assignments.

 A mail archive maintains some of
the messages we've exchanged.

 The reading and presentation
list gives dates, material, and presenters for the reading
assignments.

 The syllabus is still available,
though somewhat outdated.

  Web page assignments
are available for viewing.

 ncsu.csc.chi. is
our very own newsgroup, with almost no traffic.




 
Lecture notes


The list below gives you the overheads that I presented during each
lecture, each on its own page.   Condensed postscript  links
give you a condensed version of the same text, with no page breaks
between individual overheads.   Additional information  gives
you more info about points I may have mentioned during class, but not
in detail.
