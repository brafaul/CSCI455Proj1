Course Description

  Emergent programming styles for solving problems with a variety of
  parallel models.  Paradigms basic to the design of efficient
  parallel algorithms, methods of problem decomposition, models for
  evaluating program performance, and techniques for optimizing
  parallel compilers.  A wide variety of problems with programming
  exercises on Linda TS/Net, illustrating a general approach to 
  programming parallel machines.


Requirements: 
3 programming assignments, midterm and final.

Prerequisites: 
Computer Science 323a.


Syllabus
The syllabus for the course in Fall 1996 is as follows:

Week of
Sept 4: Overview and logistics [W]; [PART I: BASIC PARALLEL
PROGRAMMING...]  intro to parallelism and coordination; basic
paradigms [F] (How, chaps 1, 2, except 2.6...)

Sept 9: basic paradigms; paradigm "discussion exercises"; Linda
(logic); basic distributed data structures; Linda: using the system.
(chaps 3,4)

Sept 16: basic approaches to a simple problem (primes finding)
(chap 5); agenda parallelism and db search... (chap 6...);

Sept 25: (no class Sept 23) result parallelism: string
comparison and matrix problems (chap 7);  a network program,
the data fusion problem and software architecture (chap 8 +
handout);

Sept 30: (asynchronous) data parallelism (handout);

Oct 7: adaptive parallelism (handout); Coordinated and distributed
applications; 

Oct 14: [PART II: THE CONTEXT AND UNDERPINNINGS OF PARALLEL
PROGRAMMING: ARCHITECTURE, LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION, OTHER SOFTWARE
MODELS...]  hardware platforms: multiprocessors and LANs (handout);

Oct 21: midterm (Fri)

Oct 28: implementation of Linda (shared memory, multiprocessors,
networks);

Nov 4: coordination models: operating system models; message passing
systems (CSP. PVM, MPI); parallel Fortrans (and parallelizing Fortran
compilers); systolic arrays; object-oriented programming and
parallelism;

Nov 11: [PART III: BIG TENT PARALLELISM: DISTRIBUTED APPS, INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT, THE NET]  big-picture coordination: the internet; web;
WAN applications; the "information superhighway," utopia, nirvana,
etc.  (handouts);

Nov 18:  programming the internet (Java, "JavaSpaces"; net-based 
information management apps (browsers, "Lifestreams");

Dec 2: figuring out the big picture: future of net languages and
net apps; where is the internet going?  What's the point, anyway?
