22C:294 Seminar on Systems and Networks




22C:294 
  Seminar on Systems and Networks
  Course Home Page for Spring 1996 

 Instructor:  Ted Herman 
 Meeting time and place: 15:30 MWF in 110 MLH 
  Content:  
The seminar will be a research-oriented investigation 
of selected topics in the area of distributed computing.  
To illustrate some of the fundamental and most interesting
aspects of recent research, I have chosen some problems
and results that are self-contained and have a puzzle-like
quality:                     

  Wait-Free Objects  ---
under certain conditions,
data structure operations can be concurrent  and 
guarantee that no single operation is ever blocked. 
  Self-Stabilization  --- 
how to write programs
that always correct themselves after external disruptions. 
  Firing Squad  ---  
a number of simply stated 
synchronization problems have elegant solutions.
  Register Constructions  --- 
is it possible to create ``atomicity'' or related notions from components
that themselves are not atomic?
  Interval Routing  ---  
for certain types
of networks, routing tables can be quite compact using
graph-theoretic properties.
  Sorting Networks  ---
actually not a ``network''
in the sense of the Internet, these special-purpose 
structures show how parallel sorting, counting, and
load-balancing can be implemented.
  Garbage Collection  --- 
in a system with distributed objects, when and how
are ``orphans'' reclaimed?

  Workload:  Students are expected to work on 
some projects and give presentations;  since this is 
a research seminar, creativity will be emphasized.   
  Textbook:  There will be no textbook for 
the course; we will look at papers from the literature.
  Prerequisites:  The student should have taken
22C:194 Distributed Systems or have some equivalent 
exposure to basic problems of asynchronous distributed
computing.  If in doubt, come ask me!
