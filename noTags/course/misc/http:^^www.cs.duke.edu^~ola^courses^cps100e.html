  Course Overview  


Covers the same material that's in CPS 100 which is:
data structures, analysis of algorithms, data
abstraction and abstract data types, object-oriented programming, proofs
of correctness, complexity and computability, sorting and searching. 


However, CPS 100E assumes no prior knowledge of C++ (this is
assumed in CPS 100).  Instead, students are expected to have
prior experience programming with functions, arrays, and (ideally)
records/structs as might be learned in a course using Pascal or C.
Students who do well on the Advanced Placement Computer Science A exam
(4/5) or who earn a 3 on the AB exam, should elect this course.  Complete


information on choosing a first course in computer science is accessble.


 Texts 


 A Computer Science Tapestry: Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++ by Owen Astrachan (McGraw-Hill)
 
  Algorithms, Data Structures and Problems Solving with C++
 by Mark Weiss (Addison-Wesley)
 
 (optional)  Introduction to the Public Clusters at Duke 
available at Gothic Bookshop
 
 (optional)  C++, How to Program  Deitel and Deitel



 Computing 

All programs should compile and execute on acpub Sun workstations.  They
should be compiled with g++ v. 2.7.2.  You will need to alter your
path to have access to this version of the compiler.  Sparc
Clusters are found in Teer 106, 139 Hudson Hall, Soc/Psych
133, Bio-Sci 002CC, and Carr 125.  All programs/projects will be
submitted electronically.

 Collaboration 

You may (and should) work with someone else on programs.
You may  not  collaborate on written assignments or
quizzes.  For each assigment you are expected to include a list of
consultants and collaborators as part of the README that must be
submitted.
 You may not work with the same person on two consecutive
assignments without prior permission. 

 Grading 




  
major programming assignments


30%



  
written/minor programming assignments


10%



  
labs


8%



  
random quizzes


6%



  
tests (2)


26%



  
final


20%





Grading is done on an absolute, but adjustable scale.  This means that
there is no curve.  Anyone earning 90% or more of the total number of
points available will receive a grade in the A range; 80% = B, 70% =
C, 60% = D. This scale may go down, but it will not go up.  In order to
earn an A+ you must do several of the optional assignments.  These points
count even if you don't earn an A+.


There will be several optional assignments.  Completion of these can
earn points towards raising a grade by a half-step, e.g., from C+ to B-.
In some cases it may be possible to raise a grade by more than one step.
Completion of some of the optional assignments
is mandatory in order to earn an A+.


The tests will be closed-book, the final exam will be open book.


Random quizzes will be given out in class and then flipped-for at the
beginning of the next class.

 Late Assignments 


Assignments have an early due date and a final due date.  Normally
these dates will be on Monday (at midnight).
Assignments turned in on the early due
date will earn a 10% bonus (based on the total value of the
assignment).  

Assignments turned in after the final due date are penalized 25%.
No assignment will be accepted more than one week after the
final due date. Exceptions to this rule may be granted in
advance, but not after the fact.


 Newsgroup and mail 

You should monitor the newsgroup duke.cs.cps100e on a regular
basis.  Information about changes in assignments, due dates, and
hints/help will be posted there.  News is the preferred forum for
asking/answering questions.


You may want to ask questions by email, this is ok.  If you have a
question about code, you should submit the code (all relevant files)
using the appropriate submit command and send email.  You should set up
acl permission on your cps100e directory for the professor and TA/UTA to
have access to the directory.

 World Wide Web 

All course materials, except for daily notes, are accessible from the
class home page.  This page is accessible from the Duke Course page and
from Prof. Astrachan's homepage.  The URL is

http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/courses/cps100e.html  (how's that for
self-referential). 

 Dishonesty Policy 

You may discuss problems with other students, but strong collaboration
is limited to one partner on major programming assignments.  If you have
such a partner, your writeup and final program should still be your own,
except for the final project(s)  when a group can submit one program.
You must work on your own on written assignments an on minor programming
assignments.  If you get help of a substantive nature on an assignment,
you must acknowledge this assistance in your README file.
