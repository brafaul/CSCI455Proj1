General Information
Course description: This course is for students
interested in advanced program manipulation techniques and supporting
tools.  The course will present methods and techniques of program
analysis and program transformation, techniques and algorithms for
programming environments, as well as a survey of current systems in
this area.  Students will implement program analyses and
transformations and experiment with programming environments as part
of the course.

Prerequisites: one of C311 or B521, one of P423 or
P523, and a working knowledge of C or Scheme, or instructor's
permission | Credits: 3

	incrementalization: finite differencing,
	     inplace update,
	     caching, memoization, tabulation, tupling,
	     	  thining, 
             promotion, accumulation, ...
	
program refinement (data-driven optimization):
         representation selection, data localizing, staging transformation,
	 compile-time garbage collection, ...
    program modification and reuse:
        parallelizing programs,
	serializing parallel programs,
        program integration, ...
    
Programming environments techniques: an overview
    
syntax:
     incremental parsing, higher-order abstract syntax, ...
    semantics/analysis:
     incremental attribute evaluation,
     extensions to attribute grammars, e.g.,
       higher-order, composable, modular, coupled, ...
    transformation/utilities:
    second-order pattern matching, unification,
    language for complex tree transformation,
    tree rewriting,

Program manipulation systems: an overview
    
 catalog:
    compiler construction tools, frontend and backend generators,
    attribute grammar based systems,
    programming environment generators,
    program transformation systems,
    specialized utilities
       examples:
