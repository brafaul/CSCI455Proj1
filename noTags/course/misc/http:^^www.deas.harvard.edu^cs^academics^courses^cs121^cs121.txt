here.
Wed Sep 18 12:45:18 1996:
Problem section this Friday
There will be an optional problem section this Friday in Aiken 
G-23 from 2pm to 4pm.  The topic will be "How to do Proofs".
Wed Sep 18 12:54:44 1996:
Old handouts
The handouts distributed during Tuesday's lecture are available in
University Hall 4.  Each day's lecture notes (and any other applicable
handouts) will be made available there shortly after the conclusion
of lecture.

Lecture Hall change
Starting on Tue Sep 24, lectures will be in the Boylston Hall
Auditorium.  Boylston Hall is in the yard next to Widener.
Fri Sep 20 15:15:00 1996:
Regular Sections
If you signed up for section before 14:00 on Fri, Sep 20, you should
have been assigned to a section.  If you didn't receive automatic
notification of your section assignment, please look
here.

Fri Sep 20 15:15:00 1996:
Additional Section
There will be a section at 4:00 on Tue, Sep 24 in Aiken G23.
Please try to attend this section if you can't attend your regular
Sunday or Monday section because of the holiday.
Sun Sep 22 13:23:00 1996:
Correction to Problem Set 0
Problem 4b of PS0 should be corrected to read
"Is the overlap relation reflexive?  If so, prove it.  If not, 
provide a counterexample."
The formal definition of overlap originally expected is in fact 
reflexive.  However, there exists an alternate definition of this relation, 
equally reasonable, but different in some minor details, which is not 
reflexive.  Your answer to 4b should be consistent with your definition, 
as should your justification of that answer.
Tue Sep 24 12:58:13 1996:
Proof section repeated this Friday
The problem section on "How to do Proofs" which was held last Friday
will be repeated this Friday from 2-4pm in Aiken G-23.

Sunday evening section relocated
Ben's Sunday 7:00-8:00 section will be held from now on in Science
Center B-09.
