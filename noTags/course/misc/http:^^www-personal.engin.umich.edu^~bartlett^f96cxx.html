EECS/CS 284 section 1, Fall 1996


EECS/CS 284 section 1

 On Friday,
Central Campus students put your program under the door of my office
1829 East Hall. North Campus students use 1213 EECS. 

 The midterms are graded and on the bookshelf outside 1119 EECS. The solution
 is posted on the wall outside 1213 EECS. I miss counted the number of points
on the test, so the last question was extra credit.
