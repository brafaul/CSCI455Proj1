Description

This 3 quarter sequence is taught as a first introduction to 2D and
3D computer graphics. Topics covered include scan conversion of lines and
polygons, basic image processing, sampling, aliasing and antialiasing,
modeling and viewing transformations, represenations of curves and surfaces,
user interfaces, hidden surface removal algorithms, reflection and lighting
models, and illumination computations. Many of the techniques will be taught
in an interactive graphics framework with an emphasis on event driven programming
and standard graphics programming libraries such as OpenGL and OpenInventor.
