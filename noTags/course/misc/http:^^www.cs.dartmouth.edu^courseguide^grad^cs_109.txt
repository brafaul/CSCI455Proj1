Theory of Computation

Theory of Computation
(Computer Science 109)
Times: 97W: Arrange 
Instructors: Young 
Prerequisite: Computer Science 45 
	and 49 

This course explores the notion of computability restricted to a model of computation with one or more
bounded resources (e.g., time or space). Models of computation studied will be chosen from circuits and
various kinds of Turing machines: deterministic, nondeterministic, alternating, and probabilistic. Emphasis
will be on the mathematical structure of classes of problems rather than on individual problems.
