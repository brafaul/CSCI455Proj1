Course Overview
The content of this course will depend largely on student backgrounds.
In any case, we will take an in-depth look at design and implementation
issues for object-oriented programming languages. Your core activity will
be to implement a variety of object-oriented language mechanisms using
Scheme. We will develop a core language implementation, and the programming
assignments will typically involve extending this core in various ways.
This should give you a chance to spend less time coding and more time thinking.

We will spend a significant part of our lecture time discussing the
assignments and presenting solutions. The problems tend to be open-ended,
and we learn a lot from seeing how others approach a problem. These are
not formal presentations, and you should come to every class prepared to
present your current work. 
Around the middle of the term, you will also be asked to pick a topic
for a short paper. The paper will address one of the topics raised in the
course, and should involve a literature survey as well as some original
thought. The paper will be due by the end of finals week. I will probebly
require paper drafts at some point in November so I can give you some early
feedback.
