Course Material:
 Computer Science 143 is a two-hour beginning course in computer
organization and fundamental programming concepts.  The course will 
analyze fundamental concepts involved in understanding how computers
work and will provide significant programming experience in MIPS
assembly language.

Prerequisites:
 CS 142 suggested.

Computer Laboratory
 The Macintosh lab, located in room 1121 will be used for all programming
assignments.  There are approximately 20 machines designated for CS-143 
use.  These machines are available on an unscheduled basis, however,
students should plan their time so that the labs can be completed in advance
of the due date in order to avoid heavy use times.  The T.A.s are available
in the lab for simple syntax questions only.  Some of the T.A.s may not
be familiar with the MIPS assembly language.


Lab Fee
Each student must purchase two (2) yellow Computer Science Materials cards 
at the bookstore information desk (upstairs), sign them, put your

CID

number on them, 
and drop them in 
the box provided in the lab. 


 Additional information including


Lab hours and help sections, 


Lab descriptions, 


assignments, 


class schedule, 


grading, 


sample exam questions,


MIPS instruction set summary,

and

MIPS assembly examples 


can be found on the WWW page for CS-143.  You
can view the page using netscape on the machines in the lab.  You
should plan to attend one of the "How to use the cs143 lab" help 
sections to find out how to get started.
