Course Overview
CS 480 is a design practicum that stresses systematic software development 
techniques applied to the definition, design, coding, testing, and
documentation of a computer programming project.  Each student will
work on an individual project for a real customer.
Prerequisites
Senior standing in Computer Science and completion of Eng 317.

Textbook   
None required, but if you want a reference to use, any recent software
engineering
text should provide the information you need.  Another book that has been
suggested as containing material important to this course and CS 481 is
Code Complete, Steve McConnell, Microsoft Press, 1993.

Grading
A numerical grading system will be employed with the final grade based on the weighted sum of the points accumulated in each of the above categories.  Final grades will be determined by a "curve" based on class performance, but in no case will the curve b





e more severe than a standard (90, 80, 70, etc.) curve.
