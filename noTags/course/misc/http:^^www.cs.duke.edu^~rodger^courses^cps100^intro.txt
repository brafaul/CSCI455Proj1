  Assignments  

  Assignment 1  

    Getting Started (html)  
This is ready for use! 
    Assignment 1 (html) 
Now due Wed. Sept. 18, 8am


You can start the assignment now. Necessary files have been setup.
You should take a look at the Getting Started handout first. It shows
you how to setup your environment for this course.

 This is just a warmup programming assignment. You should be able to
do this assignment using a Vector (or array if you prefer). You do not
need to use Stacks, Hash Tables, Trees or other data structures you might
know about. We will be covering these structures and their implementation in
C++ later in the semester. For this assignment, I am not looking for the best
solution, just a solution. Using these other data structures might
make the assignment longer than intended.

    Assignment 2 (html) 
Now Due: Wed. Oct. 2, 8am (by Mon. Sept 30, 8am earns 2 bonus points)
    Assignment 2 hints 
    Assignment 2 sample solution .h
Note: this was thrown together quickly by jsr so it may not
follow all the style rules you are suppose to follow, it may have typos,
and it is not the only way to do this assignment. Keep that in mind...
    Assignment 2 sample solution .cc 
Note: this was thrown together quickly by jsr so it may not
follow all the style rules you are suppose to follow, it may have typos,
