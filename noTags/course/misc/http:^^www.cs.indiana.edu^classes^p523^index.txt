All projects are coded in properly

Code generator generates assembly code for the
Alpha AXP processor.
Projects should be run on zinc or copper
(click here to request an account).
Written project reports are required as well as
electronic submission of code.
Projects are graded on style, presentation, and efficiency
as well as function.
Projects require a significant amount of time and effort, so start early.
Care and neatness pay off.
Each project counts equally towards final grade.
Some project due dates have a one-week grace period during which projects
may be handed in without penalty.
Please make an effort to hand in your projects by the official due dates,
and use the grace periods only for emergencies.
You will fall behind if you consistently miss the due date, as the class
will have moved on to the next topic by the time the official due date has
passed.

Quizzes:

May be given any time w/o notice
Do not count towards final grade!
