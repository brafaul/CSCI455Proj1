The Mind and Computation Seminar features talks
by IU graduate students and faculty and occasional visitors on
topics in artificial intelligence, other areas of computational
cognitive science, and human-computar interaction.  All Computer
Science students doing or considering research in AI are encouraged to
enroll.  Enrollees who have already passed the Computer Science
Screening Examination will be expected to present one talk during the
academic year, either on their own research or on a survey of a topic
of general interest.  Others will be expected to attend regularly.



The Seminar is offered as a 1-credit course
in both the fall and spring semesters.  In order to receive credit for
more than one semester, students must make at least one presentation
to the group for every two semesters in which they are enrolled.  For
students who have passed the Computer Science
Screening Exam, this will normally take
the form of a 50-minute talk on their own research.  For less advanced
students, the presentation will usually consist of a 20-minute talk,
either on their own research or on an area of current interest in AI.



Graduate students from departments other than Computer Science are
also welcome to enroll, and people not enrolled are welcome to
attend the talks.



There are six or seven MaC meetings each semester, Fridays, 3:30-4:30 in
Lindley Hall 102.
