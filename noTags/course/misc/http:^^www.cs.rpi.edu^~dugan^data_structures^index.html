Overview

This course focuses on the basic principles of Data Structures.
Students learn the basic Data Structures and Algorithms that are used
in applications throughout Computer Science.  The course begins with a
thorough review of Object Oriented Programming and C++.  The core Data
Structures are then introduced including: Pointers, Arrays, Stacks,
Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, and Queues.  These Data
Structures are then applied to problems like Dictionaries, Discrete
Event Simulation, Shortest Paths, and Topological Sorting.  Using
the Data Structures as a base, students then investigate some of the
fundamental Algorithms of Computer Science.  These include: Sorting,
Balanced Trees, Graphs, NP-hard problems, Splay Trees, and Memory
Management.  In addition to course lectures and exams, students will
also be responsible for four significant programming projects.

us or the TAs to get one!


The course instructors will strive to maintain as much information
about the course on-line as possible.  To access this information, you
should be familiar with internet applications such as Email,
Usenet, and Web Browsing tools.


If you don't have experience using these tools, pick up the
"RCS for DUMMIES" booklet, written by Eta Kappa Nu, and available
at the VCC Help Desk.  This booklet will help you get started.

Newsgroup

A newsgroup, 

news:rpi.courses.Fall96.DataStructures, 
has been set up for this course.


This is a recommended way to ask a question of your fellow
class mates... or to ask us or the TAs a question that you think everyone
would be interested in hearing about... or to post information that
you think would be useful to the class.

Email

If you have a personal or private question or concern, then just
send the instructors or the TAs e-mail, don't post it to the Newsgroup.

Policy on Collaboration

No collaboration is permitted on exams.

You are encouraged to work with other students in the class on the
assignments.  Useful forms of collaboration include discussing design
alternatives, details of algorithms and data structures, possible
sources of reusable code, and help with debugging, compiling,
makefiles, etc.

You are also encouraged to practice code reuse, with the stipulation
that any reused code submitted as part of your assignment must be
clearly and explicitly attributed.  Code that can be reused includes
that found in the textbooks, code from previous work you have done (in
this class or others), and code from other books or Internet sites.

You may NOT reuse code written by another student in the class.  

The easiest way to attribute any code that you reuse is with a
comment.  You must give enough information so that the TAs can find
the code themselves.  Examples:

  /* the following code is from p.111 of Weiss textbook */
  class vector { ...

  /* the following code is from my CS I project, Feb 1995. */

  /* the following code was downloaded from ftp://ftp.cs.rpi.edu/pub/... */

  /* the following code is from the book "Advanced C++" by James Coplien,
   * Addison-Wesley, 1992, p.152
   */


Collaboration and discussion does not mean that the assignments may be
done jointly; each assignment you submit must be 100 percent your own
work.  You must be especially carefull when discussing another
student's code (perhaps to help with finding a bug).  DO NOT copy any
of the code, either on paper or electronically.  DO NOT write any code
for the other student, even just to fix a typographical error.  DO NOT
look and another student's code and then sit down and write nearly
identical (but not quite) code yourself.  DO NOT "paraphrase" code
from another source and fail to attribute it in a comment.

Any code submitted which the TAs find too similar to another students
code, or any code which is similar to code from a book or another
source which has not been properly attributed, will result in a zero
for the assignment in question and possibly a failing course grade.
Policy on Late Work

Homeworks are due at 11:59:59 PM, on the due date.  Late homeworks will 
be accepted with a penalty of 10% per day for 3 days.  After that, the
project will not be accepted.

Exams are to be taken at the specified date and time.  If you miss the
exam, you will receive a 0.

Sometimes things happen. If there are circumstances that prevent you
from meeting your obligations for this course, you need to talk to us
or the TAs to make arrangements IN ADVANCE.
Dropping the Course

We want you to stay in the course!  Please talk to us before you 
decide to drop.  If things can't work out, the drop
date is September 30, 1996
