Distributed Operating Systems (Enterprise-wide Computing Systems)



 CS 6523 Distributed Operating Systems (Enterprise-wide Computing Systems)


Distributed Operating Systems is being taught with an emphasis on
enterprise-wide computing environments. The current activity in
enterprise-wide computing is due in part to the explosion of interest
in Internet applications and the spread of nationwide gigabit networks
as mandated by the NII.
