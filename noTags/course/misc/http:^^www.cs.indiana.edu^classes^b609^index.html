Conceptual Models of Computing


B609: Conceptual Models of Computing

A. Introduction
 Could a computer be conscious? What would a continuous programming language be like?  What kind of "materiality" exists on the Web?  How will computation affect the future of science?  What about quantum and DNA computers?  Is it ethical to give computers power over human life?

 Addressing such questions requires knowing what computers are, and what computation is -- to a depth (it is argued in this course) beyond that reached by current theories.  Come and find out why: what we know, what we don't know, what a more adequate theory would look like.


A critical examination of the conceptual foundations of computing,
focusing on:


The models and metaphors in terms of which we understand
        computing -- from programs to processes, architecture to
        abstraction, parameterization to parallelism; and

 The use of computational concepts in adjacent fields -- from
        cognitive science to physics, economics to art.

 Initially, we focus on six traditional views: formal symbol manipulation, recursive function theory, effective computability & computational complexity, digital state machines, information processing, and Newell and Simon's notion of a physical symbol system.  Non-standard views are also considered, such as connectionism, non-linear dynamics, and artificial life.  Throughout, each view is judged by its ability to do justice to practice.  We conclude by briefly considering the wider role of computational concepts in intellectual life -- including their affect on our self-conception.

C. Content

Reading: Primary reading will be selections from the
       first 3 volumes of the instructor's forthcoming series of books
       on the philosophy of computation (The Middle Distance: An
       Essay on the Foundations of Computation and Intentionality).
       Supporting material to be selected from Dretske, Dreyfus,
       Fodor, Goodman, Haugeland, Hayes, Kleene, Minsky, Newell,
       Penrose, Shannon, Simon, Turing, Webb, and others.

  Prerequisites: No formal prerequisites; students should
       have substantial computational expertise (typically from a
       combination of programming and instruction) and familiarity
       with conceptual argumentation (typically from one or more
       philosophy courses). If in doubt please contact the instructor.

  Grading: No midterm or final exam. Three or four
       "problem sets" will be distributed, each consisting
       of a series of structured essay questions (a term paper may be
       substituted for final problem set, at the student's
       discretion). The notion of a "right" or
       "wrong" answer is considered inappropriate; grades
       wil be based on the clarity, imagination, and depth of
       answer. Experience suggests that it will take the typical
       student ~20 hours to complete each problem set to a grade-A
       level.

  Format: It is (tentatively) planned that problem
       set responses will be submitted on-line,
       where they will be graded, cross-referenced, and made available
       to other class members.  An on-line discussion of each question
       will be conducted after problem sets solutions have been
       submitted.

  Sections: No formal sections. Students are encouraged
       to work on problem sets in groups, provided a list of group
       members is included with the response.
