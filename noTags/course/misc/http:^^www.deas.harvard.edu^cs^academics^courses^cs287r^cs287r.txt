Announcements:


Mon Mar 18 10:09:00 1996 - Précis Server
Available Carlo Martino has graciously set up an email server
for précis submitted for CS287.  All précis should be
submitted to the server, rather than to lib287.  Submission
instructions can be found at the server
Web site.  Upon submission, all précis will be made
available automatically from that site.  You can also submit responses
or further discussion to the server.  Those of you who have already
submitted précis for Chapter 8, please resend them as per the
instructions.


Tue Mar 12 20:51:22 1996 - Class and problem set
rescheduled Due to a last minute scheduling snafu, Emmanuel
Roche's presentation on finite-state transducers has been rescheduled
from Thursday, March 14 to Monday, March 18, 4-5:30 pm.  There will
therefore be no class held on Thursday, March 14.  The due date for
Problem Set 7, initially scheduled for March 14, is correspondingly
changed to Monday, March 18.  Similarly, the precis for Chapter 8 of
the book "Finite State Devices..." should be sent in on Monday, March
18.  Further information on the precis is available here.

Tue Feb 27 12:27:05 1996 - Solutions for problem set 1
Problem set 1 solutions are now available
on-line.

Tue Feb 20 18:48:51 1996 - Script for packaging problem set solutions: Problem set
solutions can be packaged up with the uufiles
script.  Running the script with "uufiles -gz" causes the
user to be prompted for a directory and a set of filenames to be
tarred, gzipped, and uuencoded into a self-extracting archive.



Old announcements will be archived here.
