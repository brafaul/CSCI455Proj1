CSC 302: Numerical Methods








CSC 302:Introduction to Numerical Methods

Motivation
Numerical methods are the key bridge between non-computer scientists 
(engineers, economists, medical researchers, mathematicians, scientists of 
all flavors, and engineers of all flavors) and computer science.  It is 
crucial that computer scientists understand one of the most common styles,
languages, and class of problems for which non-computer scientists use 
computers.

Where and When
Class meets from 4:05 to 5:20 pm on Tuesday and Thursday in Daniels 406.
