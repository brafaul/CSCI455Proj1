Classwork and grading

There will be no tests.
Grading will be based subjectively on the assignments
and three medium-sized projects.
Throughout the course there will be a few
small assignments.
Most of the grade will be based on three medium-sized
projects to be done individually.
Students may choose whatever projects they wish.
Oral presentations,
demonstrations of the application
and written reports
are expected.


We will use tuck.cs.fit.edu which has
all the software we need installed on it.

Harris Lab

Possible projects

Games
  Mastermind, go, orthello, crossword puzzles, minesweeper
  Tutoring
  Elementary arithmetic, multiple choice tests,
      foreign languages (with sound), programming languages,
