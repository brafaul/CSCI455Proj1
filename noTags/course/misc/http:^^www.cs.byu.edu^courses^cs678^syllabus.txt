CS 678 Syllabus - Fall '94










CS678 - Syllabus 

Since CS678 is a research course tailored to the needs of the current
students enrolled, there is no set syllabus.  Following is a list of the
topics which we covered indepth in the first CS678 offering.
 

 Extended ASOCS coverage
 Hamming Networks
 Learning by a critic and the Associate Search Network
 Genetic Algorithms
 Self Organizing Topological Feature Maps
 Counterpropagation networks
 BAM's (bidirectional associative memories)
 Boolean Networks
 How to write Journal/Conference Research papers.  Each student was
required to write a journal style research paper.  This paper was not
necessarily to be published  (a couple were), but to give them the
experience of writing a careful research publication.
 RCE's (Restricted Coloumb Energy Networks)
 Implementation of actual applications in neural networks
