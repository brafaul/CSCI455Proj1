Textbook: Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, Introduction to Computer Algorithms, McGraw-Hill, 1990.
Errata for the textbook, instructor's notes for selected topics, and other
materials are on 
reserve in D.H. Hill Library and/or accessible from the class
WWW page.

Grading:

Plus/minus grading will be used.
30\% closed-book exam, Tues. Sept. 24.
30\% closed-book exam, Thurs. Oct. 31. 
40\% open-book final exam, Tues. Dec. 10, 8:00-11:00.
0\% problem sets -- approximately every 10 days.
No programming projects.
Opportunities to earn extra credit are unlikely, and,
if available, will be offered to all students on the same basis.

Drop Date: October 25.  All changes in course status must be 
handled through the registrar.



Problem Sets:

Homework problem sets will be assigned on a regular basis.  The problems are
generally pencil-and-paper problems, although it is not inappropriate to apply
computing resources.  Model solutions will be made available on specified due
dates.  The principal incentive for doing homework (aside from intellectual
curiosity!) is to be prepared for exams; no explicit credit will be given for
homework.  (If available TA resources permit, some problem sets will be
collected and selected problems will be read and commented upon.)  Since no
grades are assigned, you are free to work together; however, it is
important at exam time that you be able to write up solutions in your own
words.  One approach might be to meet with other students to discuss and
perhaps solve problems, then reconstruct the solution later without using
notes.
