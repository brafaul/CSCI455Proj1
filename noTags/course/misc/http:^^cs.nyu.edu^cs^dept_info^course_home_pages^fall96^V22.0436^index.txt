Lectures:



can be accessed through the course schedule

Assignments:

are listed on the course schedule
6 graded assignments

assignments 1 through 4 will involve programming: sample programs

in class will be given in C, but assignments may be done in any

general purpose language 

(please ask if you want to use something other than C or Pascal)

programming assignments will involve simulation of circuits,

starting with very simple circuits and leading (in assignment

#4) to simulation of an entire very simple CPU

for graded assignments, there is a penalty of 10% of grade

for each weekday the assignment is late (assignments submitted

after class on the date due should be put in my mailbox, either

in Warren Weaver or at 715 Broadway)

occasional ungraded assignments: 


we will record only whether these have been submitted

these will be used to make decisions in case of borderline

grades

these assignments will be gone over in class

will not be accepted after the date due 




Grading:

50% assignments

(assignment #4 is the largest, and will be counted more heavily

than the others)

20% mid-term

30% final exam 



Course goals:


philosophical: understand how a computer can be built from basic

components (switches)



practical: understand how the constant quest for higher performance

is affecting architecture development
