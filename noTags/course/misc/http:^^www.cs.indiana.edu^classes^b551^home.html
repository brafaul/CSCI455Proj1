Class Newsgroup 

When the 
class newsgroup is created it will be possible to
access it from this page.

If you do this from lynxor netscape,
you can post and respond to articles, as well as read them.





AI/Cog Sci societies 

If you're interested in going deeper into AI/Cog Sci, you should consider
joining societies such as the  American
Association for Artificial Intelligence, the  Cognitive Science
Society, or the ACM's  SIGART.
All offer very reasonable student membership rates
including publications (AI Magazine, Cognitive
Science, and  SIGART Bulletin).

Mailing lists for local (Indiana University) Cog
Sci announcements and discussion

Cognoscente is a mail server account used for announcements of
Cognitive Science Meetings, Conferences and Colloquia at Indiana
University. Please do not use this for 
discussion purposes or to send individual messages.

Cogd is a local Indiana University mailing list available for
those within Cognoscente for discussion purposes only.   

If you wish you can subscribe or unsubscribe to these  lists by doing the
following:

Scheme references 
The following are recommended sources for brushing up on scheme, and should
be available at Swain library or in local bookstores:

 Dybvig, R. K. The Scheme programming language, Prentice-Hall,
1987.
 Friedman, D.P. and Felleisen, M. The Little Schemer.  MIT Press, 1996.
 Springer, S. and Friedman, D. Scheme and the art of programming.
MIT Press, 1989.


In addition to the above books, the following may be useful:

 Some practice problems for
testing your Scheme familiarity.

 A crash introduction to scheme 

The course will be in LH004 ("the Burrow") in three sessions:

        TIME/DATE                       WHAT WE'LL COVER
        Th, 5th,  4:35 -  5:35pm        scheme basics, emacs&scheme
        F,  6th, 10:00 - 11:30am        most common scheme constructs,
                                          designing/building functions
        F, 13th, 10:00 - 11:30am        style, advanced stuff (no call/cc!),
                                          more complex examples

Students will need to get accounts for these machines, if they don't
already have them (quite probably they don't).  They can do this by
doing "telnet account", selecting "UNIX systems", and then selecting
"Burrow account".

The following preparation is recommended:

 Read chapters 1-2 of The Little Schemer, and on p. 33 (the
first page of chapter 3), try to write "rember."  (Code for rember is
on page 37.)  Then go through 1-2 again trying out the code in
scheme. Or,

 Read Chapter 2, sections 2-1 to 2-8 inclusive of
The Scheme programming language.  Again, read them once and
then go through them trying out the code.  You can also try to write
rember:

>  rember:
>       Write a function that takes 2 arguments: an atom and a list.
>       Return the list with the *first* occurrence of the given atom
>       removed. (rember = remove + member)
>
>   e.g.,
>       (rember 'blue '(red white and blue))
>       => (red white and)
>
>       (rember 'tigers '(lions tigers and bears ohmy!))
>       => (lions and bears ohmy!)
>
>       (rember 'the '(attack of the the eye creatures))
>       => (attack of the eye creatures)
