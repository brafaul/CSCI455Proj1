The following paper describes the FIR filter design program
called METEOR, which is based on linear programming.


``METEOR: A Constraint-Based FIR Filter Design Program,''
K. Steiglitz, T. W. Parks and J. F. Kaiser,
IEEE Trans. Signal Processing,
vol. 40, no. 8, pp. 1901-1909, August 1992. (293k postscript file)


The following are sources for the program FORM, which
is an interactive program that generates input for METEOR,
and METEOR itself. Note that the C sources have been automatically 
translated from Pascal, and have a library prepended to be 
self-contained. The original Pascal is much more readable.


C source for the input formatter, form.c (translated from Pascal)



Pascal source for the input formatter, formJ.p



C source for main program, meteor.c (translated from Pascal)



Pascal source for main program, meteorJ.p


Test input file for form (to edit) or 
meteor (to run)
