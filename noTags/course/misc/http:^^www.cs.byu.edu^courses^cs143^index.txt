Here 

 is a list of the GRADES as of 11/18/1996 including Midterm.


Here are some Help pages for labs. 
Not every lab will have a help page, so you are best advised to go the
a help session and talk to a TA.


MIPS 

LAB#3 

Show Hanoi for last lab. 

TestHanoi is a Sample program that uses ShowHanoi 

DON'T USE  experimental show hanoi II.

TOKENS for lab #4.

FACTORIAL CODE for Home Work Topic #4. 


TA hours are posted on the lab door in TMCB 1147. There are no hours on
Holidays and Sundays. Labs will be closed for university Devotionals, and
I strongly reccommend them. You can see the Devotionals in 1170 TMCB (thats
the room you have class), or in the Marriot Center.
