Synopsis Of Course Content:
This course covers topics on advanced computer architecture, and is
appropriate for both advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Building
on introductory classes which showed how a basic computer functions, this
course examines techniques for improving computer performance and usability.
This course emphasizes the interaction between hardware and software (operating
systems, compilers, and application programs), as well as the cost/performance
tradeoffs of computer architecture. Topics covered include virtual memory,
pipelining, caches (memory hierarchies), and advanced storage systems.
We will also discuss a variety of parallel computer systems and future
directions in computer architecture.
Prerequisites: CPS 104 or equivalent.
It is assumed that you are familiar with the material covered in CPS
104. If you are not familiar with that material, it is your responsibility
to become familiar. Please see me if you have any questions about required
background.
Textbook
Computer
Architecture A Quantitative Approach, 2nd Edition, John L. Hennessy &
David A. Patterson Morgan Kaufmann, 1996
Topics
Fundamentals of Computer Architecture (Chapter 1)
Instruction Set Architecture (Chapter 2, Appendix C)
Pipelining (Chapter 3)
Advanced Pipelining (Chapter 4)
Memory Hierarchy (Chapter 5)
Storage Systems (Chapter 6)
Interconnection Networks (Chapter 7)
Multiprocessors (Chapter 8)
Grade To Be Based On:
30% homework
30% project
30% exams (two midterms, and exit interview)
10% class participation
Important: Quals grade is based only on the two
midterms and exit interview
Homework (30% of grade):
Homework will be assigned throughout the semester (see handouts).
You are expected to complete the homework individually. However, I encourage
discussion between students on topics covered in this class.
Exams (30% of grade):
There will be two midterm exams and a short exit interview in this course
(see important dates)
Research
Project (30% of grade):
Course projects will be completed individually or in groups of two.
A list of possible projects will be provided. Students will create a web
page presenting the results of their projects and will give a short presentation
on their projects. Group projects are expected to entail more work than
individual projects and require 30 minute presentations (15 minutes per
student.) Projects are subject to my approval. More details will be provided
later in the semester. You should select your project by September 30.
Look here for a list of possible research probjets.
Look under Resources for available tools and other
useful links.
