CS182


DIVISION OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCES
HARVARD UNIVERSITY
CS182. Intelligent Machines:
Reasoning, Actions, and Plans

Fall '96: Mondays and Wednesdays, 1-2:30 PM
Aiken Computation Laboratory, Room 101
Instructor:  Prof. Barbara J. Grosz
Teaching Fellows:   Luke
Hunsberger and  Wheeler
Ruml
Prerequisites:  Computer Science 51; Computer
Science 121 (may be taken concurrently).
CS182 is an introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) intended
for undergraduates and graduate students with little or no previous
exposure to AI. There are many ways to approach the study of AI; CS182
will emphasize the basic techniques and mechanisms that have been
developed for the construction of intelligent systems with a focus on
reasoning and actions.  Major topics to be covered include search,
representation formalisms, strategies for reasoning using them, and
planning. Applications to language, vision, and robotics will also be
studied.
If you have any questions about the course or its prerequisites,
please feel free to contact one of the Teaching Fellows. More
