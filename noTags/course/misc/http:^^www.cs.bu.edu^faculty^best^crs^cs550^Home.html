CS-550: Advanced Computer Architecture


 

CS-550 overviews the concepts underlying the design of
high-performance computer architectures, with an emphasis on quantitative
evaluation and the interplay between computer architecture and the
design of compilers and operating systems. Topics include: pipelined,
superscalar, vector, and parallel processors; hard-wired scheduling 
and branch prediction; cache and virtual memory-hierarchy design;
shared-memory and message-passing scalable multiprocessors. Case
studies including RISC/CISC and SIMD/MIMD architectures. This course
counts for 4 credits and assumes basic knowledge of computer
systems.
