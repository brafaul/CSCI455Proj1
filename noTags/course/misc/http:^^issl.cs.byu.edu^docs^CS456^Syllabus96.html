CS 456 - Interactive Software
Introduction
This course will give a student introduction to implementation issues for
graphical user interfaces. Students will write programs in Visual C++ under
MS Windows. In addition, the basic principles of user interface design and
2D computer graphicsl will be covered.

Text:

Packet of information that will be delivered over the course of the
semester. This is a text that is being developed for this course. It will
be available as several packets sold through the bookstore. The first packet
should be available before Wednesday, Jan 10.

This material will be the primary text for the course.

VisualC++ 2 - Developing Professional Applications in Windows
and NT using MFC , Marshal Brain and Lance Lovette. 

Computers:
PC's in the open labs running windows. To access these computers you will
need CS department student account. If you are a CS major, you can get an
account by going here. If you are
not a CS major, you will need to visit the systems programmers in room 2254
TMCB. 
Course Philosophy
The goal of this course is not so much the content as learning how to learn
new systems in graphical user interfaces. Because of this we will only spend
a limited amount of time on Visual C++. Students will be taught general
concepts and then introduced to the way in which MS Windows implements those
concepts. It will be up to the student (with some help from the TA) to find
out the details necessary to complete the programming assignments.

Because of this goal of teaching how to learn, there will not be as much
lecture as in most CS classes. For each class period there will be reading
assignments and problems which must be completed before class. Most of the
class period will consist of presentation and discussion from students chosen
randomly from the class. This participation will be graded, as discussed
below. 
Grading

Exams 40% 
  
2 Tests 10% each 
  Final exam 20% (half of this exam will cover the last third of the
course and half will be comprehensive) 
  
Programs 40% (there will be 5 large programs, each reuses pieces from
previous programs) 
Class Participation 20% 
  
Students will be regularly asked to present or discuss reading materials
in class. Grading will be on whether or not you have prepared and thought
carefully about the material. Grading is based on prepared or unprepared,
not right or wrong. Missunderstandings of the material can be corrected
by class discussions and will not be counted against you.


Course Calander
Please note that there are some Friday classes and some normally scheduled
times when no class will be held. This is necessary so that I can accomodate
my travel schedule while still providing you with a full semester of instruction.
Friday classes will be offered at the same time, at a place to be announced.
