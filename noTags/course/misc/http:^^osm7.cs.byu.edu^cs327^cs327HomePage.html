 Cheating Policy
The cheating policy is simple.  If your are caught  once  at cheating  you 
    will be given an E for the course.  All cheating instances will  be  brought  
    to  the  attention  of  the department  chairman  in  an  attempt  to  have  
    the student removed from the department,  college,  or  university.  You shall 
    not  cheat  on  quizzes.  You should work together as much as possible.  
    However, it is considered cheating if you copy another person's work or do not 
    do the work yourself.

 Communication
We would like to meet with you when you have problems,  but, if  you  can't,  
    please use e-mail.  Much of the information for the class will not be given 
    on paper but instead through the WEB.
