Office hours:
 T 3:30-5, W 1:30-3
  Book:
 Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest: Algorithms.  McGraw-Hill 1990.
  Topics:

  Some commonly used algorithms and data structures.  Analysis from the
point of view of correctness, and the amount of resources used.  Some
of the topics: sorting, recursion, set data structures, dynamic
programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking, shortest path, graph
matching, some algebraic algorithms, NP problems.
  Prerequisites:
  CS112, MA293
  Kind of work required:
 Read the textbook, solve the homework
problems (may involve writing C programs as well as giving
mathematical proofs), participate in the class discussion.
  Homework:
 given, in general, on Thursday and due in class on
Tuesday 12 days later.  No credit for late homework.
  Tests:
 a midterm exam, and a final exam (closed book, closed
notes), and one or two unannounced short quizzes.
  For the tests, a single handwritten ("crib") sheet is permissible.
  Final grade:
 Approximately, 25% for homework, 25% for the
midterm, 30% for the final, 10% for the quizzes, 10% for class
participation.
  Information updates:
