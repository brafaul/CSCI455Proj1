Making a Toonces Presentation




  Overview  

A 
description of the course and an overview of what is covered.



  Requirements  
There will be a large group project (four to six person teams), two
smaller group projects, and two individual "mastery" projects.  The
mastery projects are designed to ensure that everyone who completes the
course is "certified" as capable of writing and understanding reasonably
complex C++ programs.  Since some people on the large team project may
not write any C++ code, the mastery projects are necessary for this
certification. One of the mastery projects will also use Java.  There will
be at least three written/smaller assignments/programs.



  Grading

Code Examples




Java in a Nutshell
All the examples from the O'Reilly book Java in a Nutshell.
These are accessible here, as source and runnable applets, and also
in ~ola/cps108/nutshell on both cs and acpub machines.




Templated map classes including an abstract base
class and two implementations: unsorted vector and
hash table


 map.h (abstract base class)
 uvmap.h , unsorted vector
interface
 uvmap.cc , unsorted vector
implementation
 hmap.h , hash table interface
 hmap.cc  hash table
implementation
 
 iterator.h iterator
base class
 uviterator.h iterator
class for uv map
 iterator.cc
implementation of uvmap iterator
 hiterator.h iterator
class for hashtable map
 hiterator.cc
implementation of hashtable map iterator
 iterproxy.h
proxy class for iterator (pointer proxy)





A word tracking program (counts # occurrences of all words
in a file) that uses map classes is available.


 words.cc the main
source code file
 templatewords.cc
the template instantiation file
 Makefile the
Makefile (site specific and requiring map classes)




Two views of a menu-driven program for manipulating images.  One is
non-object oriented (although there is a class used).  The other is very
object oriented and uses the Command Pattern to implement commands
used within menus (the menus are text based).


First the non object oriented version

 usepix.cc the
main  program 
 pixmap.h the
interface/header file for the Pixmap class (manipulates images)
 pixmap.cc the
implementation of the Pixmap class


The object oriented version (uses the Pixmap class too)

 application.h
the main application class interface
 application.cc
the main application class implementation
 
 command.h
the abstract base class for commands

 quitcommand.h
The quit command class interface
 quitcommand.cc
The quit command class implementation
 readcommand.h
The read command class interface
 readcommand.cc
The read command class implementation
 
displaycommand.h The display command interface
 
displaycommand.cc The display command implementation
 simpcommand.h
A templated class (using pointers to member functions) for
non-parameterized commands.

 menu.h
The menu class interface
 menu.cc
The menu class implementation
 menuitem.h
The menu item class interface
 menuitem.cc
The menu item class implementation

 filelister.h
Read one of a list of files (from a hard-wired directory) interface
 filelister.cc

 templateapp.cc
template instantiation file

 Makefile




A class for checking memory leaks (very rudimentary) by overloading
new and delete on a global basis


 heapstats.h
 heapstats.cc




In class design exercises.  Programming in the small and in the large
