Course Objectives 






EECS 373 is an introduction to microprocessor-based computer design.

During the semester, you will build an Intel 80186-based computer

containing a variety of memory and IO devices. The course will

cover the basic principles of system design, including how various

devices operate and how they can be used to form useful computing

systems. In addition, you will used state-of-the-art design tools

in the lab. While this is primarily a hardware class, you will

be expected to write software in 80186 assembly language and to

become familiar with hardware prototyping tools.

Grading Policy 


1. Labs reports are due one week after the lab work is

complete at the beginning of your next lab period. Lab hardware

demos are due at the end of lab period ( e.g., the

end of the second lab period for a two week lab). The TA, however,

may grant an extension allowing hardware demo any time before

your next lab period ( e.g., if your lab section meets

Tuesday night, you may demo anytime before 6:30 of the following

week). In this case, you may demo to any TA; the TA will

sign a copy of your code listing that you must show to your regular

TA. You are responsible for ensuring that the lab is properly

recorded as being complete.



2. One lab report per group is sufficient. Each lab will have

a prelab that is to be turned in beforethe start of that

lab. Lab grading will work as follows:


Prelab: 5%

Demonstration: 45%

Lab report: 50% 




3. In labs you may work in groups of two. Division of lab work

is permitted; however, each student is responsible for fully understanding

all aspects of the lab. Your lab TA will quiz you on your understanding

of the lab.



4. Late labs will be substantially penalized; you will lose

30% for each day the lab is late, problems with either CAEN or

lab equipment not withstanding. No labs will be collected over

weekends or holidays, but you will still be assessed 30% for each

day ( i.e., 60% for a weekend). If there is a problem with turning

in a lab on time, get in touch with Prof. Birmingham ( and only

Prof. Birmingham) as soon as possible.


4. The honor code is in force on all assignments and exams.

This means that while lab group members may collaborate on lab

assignments ( within the bounds specified above), there shall

be no sharing of code or hardware among lab groups. Members of

other groups may not help debug hardware or software of other

groups without consent from the TAs or Prof. Birmingham. Furthermore,

you are not allowed to look at the lab reports or code of others

groups, or any past 373 course. Remember, you are under obligation

to report any cheating you witness.





Grading Scheme 


Lab 1: 0%


Lab 2-8 (each): 10% 


2 Exams (each): 15%
