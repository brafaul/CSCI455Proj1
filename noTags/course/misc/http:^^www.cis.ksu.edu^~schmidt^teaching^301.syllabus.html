 More about propositional logic (parts of Lemmon, Ch. 2)	2

 Elementary number theory, mathematical induction 
  (supplemental notes, Ch. 5)	2

 Basics of program verification (Floyd-Hoare logic)
  (supplemental notes, Ch. 6)	2

 Predicate logic (Lemmon, Ch. 3)	4

 Program verification with arrays	2

The fine print section

Prerequisite policy: The prerequisite for this course is CIS200.  If you have
not taken CIS200, you must see the instructor.  (The Engineering College may
choose to drop you from this course without notice if you do not have
the prerequisite course.)


Drop policy: It is your responsibility to drop the course if you are enrolled
but decide not to complete the course.  There are no ``automatic'' drops
due to nonattendance.


Cheating policy:  The department head requires that I include in this
syllabus my policy
on cheating.  My policy is that you are expected to do your
own work on the homeworks and exams.
