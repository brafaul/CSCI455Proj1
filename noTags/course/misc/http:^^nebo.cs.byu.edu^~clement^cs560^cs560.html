CS 560 Syllabus - Winter '95










CS 560 - Computer Networks 

Winter 96  - MWF 1:00-1:50pm, 120 TMCB
 
Professor:

Mark Clement ,  3372 TMCB,  x7608  
Office Hours: MWF 11:00-12:00 or by appointment 
TA: Linus Kwong  M-F 11:00-1:00pm


Goals:
This class will examine high bit-rate networks and their applications.  We will be focusing
on fiber optic Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) 
networks and the protocols which enable their use
for telephony and lan traffic.  A large part of the grade in the class
will be based on lab projects associated with building a protocol stack 
on top of ATM.  We will also 
attempt to predict usage models for networks
in the year 2010 and analyze technology for this new era of networked computing. 

 
Text: 
David McDysan, "ATM Theory and Application"
augmented by papers given out during the semester.
 
Prerequisites: 
 CS460, Unix network programming experience.
 
 Newsgroup: 
The newsgroup byu.class.cs560 contains questions and answers to 
many common questions.  The TA would like to have you post
questions there first.

Late Policy
 All labs must be fully functional in order to get any credit.  Late labs
will have 30% of the points deducted plus 20% for each week they are overdue.
A lab that is 7 days late will receive 50% credit, 14 days = 30% credit, 21 days = 10%
credit.  Since the labs build on each other it is to your advantage to turn them in
on time.

Projects
 The last four weeks of class will be spent on a moderate sized research 
 
project .  You may work in groups or seperately on the class project.
 
Expectations

 
 I expect you to become conversant with the basics of ATM research.  This 
research area should motivate you to independent reading and thinking.
 You will spend at least 6 hours per week in laboratory work or reading.
 You will need to 
check the mosaic page at http://nebo.cs.byu.edu/~clement/cs560/cs560.html
often in order to get changes to assignments and updates to the schedule.
 All laboratory work and homework should be done independently.
You may work in a group to understand the material and questions, but
everything you turn in or pass off should be your work.  Take steps to 
protect your work from being copied by read protecting your directory.

 This page describes many of the issues involved in 

video transmission
over IP and ATM networks.
  Gunnar Karlsson, Research Report R95-14 http://www.sics.se/libindex.html
from SICS Sweden.

 
Video On Demand Architectures

from ftp://athos.rutgers.edu/pub/technical-reports/dcs-tr-311.ps.Z.

 
A Proposed Flow Specification (RFC1363)

for ATM networks.


  Introductory ATM Paper 
  describing IP over ATM.  The focus of this paper is running IP over
  ATM, but there is an extensive tutorial on ATM.
  John David Cavanaugh and Timothy J. Salo,
  "Internetworking with ATM WANs", 1992.

This page was created by Robert Walthall and containes a good 
summary of the state of research into 
  Flow Control 
  in ATM networks.

 This description of
 
non-blocking I/O 
should be helpful in the labs.
 Sample CCITT 
specification.  Additional specifications can be found through 
anonymous ftp at 
src.doc.ic.ac.uk in
the computing/ccitt/ccitt-standards/ccitt/1992 or 1988 directories.
A good source of  ATM references 
Sample socket code is available through anonymous ftp from
timp.cs.byu.edu in the pub/sockets directory or is available 
 here  as a 
shar file.
Information on  UNIX 
The Computer For The 21st Century  Scientific American Paper 
ATM FAQ 
The ATM  
Blue Book  has extensive information about protocols, standards and
products used with ATM.
 
  Parallel Computing  on ATM Networks. C. C. Huang and P. K.
  McKinley, "Communication Issues in Parallel Computing across ATM
  Networks," IEEE Parallel and Distributed Technology,
  accepted to appear, 1994.

 
  A Pipelined, Multi-Processor Architecture for a Connectionless
  Server for Broadband ISDN  is a masters thesis by Daniel Omundsen.
  I think the thesis is a good prototype for research in this field
  and has a fairly good bibliography and intro to ATM.

 
  Performance Analysis  of parallel library interfaces to ATM Networks.
