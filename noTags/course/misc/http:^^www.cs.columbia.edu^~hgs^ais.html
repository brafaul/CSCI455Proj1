TA office hours:
Monday, 3-5 pm


Day and time:
Tuesday, 6.10 pm - 8.30 pm


Credits for course:
3


Prerequisites:
The course requires some background in computer networks (e.g.,
CS4119) and programming experience (C, Unix).  Experience with Tcl/Tk
(e.g., CS 6998) might be helpful for some projects, but is not
required.


Description:
In the last three or four years, the Internet has moved beyond the three
"classical" services of email, file transfer and remote
login. This course provides an overview of some of the emerging Internet
services, their technical background and open issues. The course
focuses on two principal areas:


Real-Time and Multicast Services

Multicast routing
Properties of real-time services
Resource reservation, scheduling and transport
Streaming audio and video
Reliable multicast and application sharing
Conference control and "telephone-like" functionality
Metering, charging, settlements

WWW and its extensions

Review of WWW technologies: HTML, HTTP,URLs
WWW performance and scaling problems
The web as universal front-end (cgi, database integration)
Java and web scripting languages
HTML and beyond (SGML, VRML, PDF)
Directory services for people and services: X.500, LDAP, whois++
Electronic commerce: EDI, e-cash

Homework(s):
Five homework assignments, each including questions and small
programming problems.


Project(s):
Students are expected to complete one major programming project
during the course of the semester, leading to (at least) a technical
report and software of distributable quality.  Projects that contain
Internet measurements are encouraged.  As appropriate, homeworks will
contain small programming assignments.
Projects might include:

Web integrity measurements and assurance;
A web-based mailing list manager;
Directory services for Internet telephony;
Java applets for collaborative computing;
Bandwidth estimation and measurements;
Service differentiation for data and real-time;
Measurements and comparisons of audio and video codecs for
networks;
Quality-of-service measurements and control for the MBONE;
Floor control;

Detailed project descriptions (for
Columbia students only).


Paper(s):
See "Project(s)"


Midterm exam:
None


Final exam:
3 hours, closed book


Grading:
Homeworks 20%, project 50%, final 30%


Hardware requirements:
Internet access; other requirements depend on project chosen and
may include ability to compile C or C++, run a Java compiler.  Unix
and Windows'95/NT are strongly preferred to avoid support problems.


Software requirements:
Depends on project chosen; instructor will attempt to provide if
needed.


Homework submission:
By electronic mail to the teaching assistant.
