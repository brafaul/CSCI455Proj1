Assignment #2 notes:  (10/28/96) I have incorporated the changes Jerry Franke and
Greg Hormann suggested in the code in /u/mcmullen/agent. There are
also some more hints in the source and diff files for the two source files that
I edited (user_interface.pl and http_get.pl.) 

Course Overview
This course is intended to provide technical, programming and administrative

background and experience for a career with the World-Wide Web. Students

should have at least two semesters programming experience, or its equivalent,

and be comfortable working with an operating system such as Unix or DOS.

They should also have familiarity with the Internet and the World-Wide Web,

such as could be gained in CSCI

A148 Working the World-Wide Web.
Topics to be covered include: 

web server administration 
advanced web design and authoring 
web protocols (HTTP, gopher, FTP, WAIS, news, mail) 
interfacing services into the web (HTML forms, CGI) 
searching and indexing technologies and strategies 
programming for the web (perl, Java) 
cutting-edge technologies (VRML, secure executables, encryption) 

As needed for understanding the Web, background will be provided on Internet

network protocols and programming, standards relating to the Web (eg, URI,

SGML, MIME, MPEG, JPEG), and the historical context of the technologies.

Also, throughout the course, consideration will be given to the economical,

sociological, ethical and legal ramifications of the Web and the Internet

in general.
The course will be very hands-on and projects oriented. Students should

gain direct knowledge and experience of how to run a web site with full

functionality and how to keep current with these fast-moving technologies.

Lectures and discussions will utilize a projected computer display for the

instructor.
