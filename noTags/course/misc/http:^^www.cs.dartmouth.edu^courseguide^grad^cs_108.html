Advanced Operating Systems

Advanced Operating Systems
(Computer Science 108)
Times: 97W: Arrange 
Instructors: Danskin 
Prerequisite: Computer Science 23
	 and 37. An undergraduate course in 
	 operating systems (Computer Science 58) 
	 would be helpful. 

This course covers advanced topics in operating systems, including issues such as the hardware/software
interface, operating-system structure, CPU scheduling, concurrency, virtual memory, interprocess
communication, file systems, protection, security, fault tolerance, and transaction processing. The course
also considers many of these topics in the context of distributed systems.
