Course Description


Examines the application of paradigms in neural networks to problems in pattern classification, optimization, function approximation, and machine learning.  The course will include: review of the physiology and anatomy of neurons and neuron networks, form











al models of neurons and networks; attractor networks, associative memory; storage capacity; the pattern classification problem; neural classifiers; optimization by energy minimization, solving the TSP (Traveling Salesman problem) with attractor networks;











 simulated annealing and the Boltzmann  machine; hardware implementations of neural networks; the problem of learning; algorithmic approaches; perceptron learning; back-propagation; randomized algorithms; and genetic algorithms.
