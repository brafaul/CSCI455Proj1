Implementation of Programming Languages

Implementation of Programming Languages
(Computer Science 48)
Times: 97S: 2 
Instructors: Aslam 
Prerequisite: Computer Science 23, 37 and 49. Computer Science 25 is recommended. 
Dist: TAS 


Techniques for automatic translation of programming languages are discussed. The course includes a brief
survey of various techniques and formalisms that can be used for describing the syntax and semantics of
programming languages, for describing abstract and concrete machine architectures, and for describing
program translation and transformation. Most of the course is concerned with the construction of a
compiler that will translate an algebraic language into machine code for a conventional architecture
machine. Offered in alternate years.
