Beth Katz's CS161 Fall 1996


Computer Science 161 - Fall 1996
last updated November 18, 1996
This page describes Beth Katz's section of CS 161 (161.05).
However, if you are in the other sections, info here may be useful.
For instance, all sections are using the same text
(Owen Astrachan's A Computer Science Tapestry:
Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++.)
Dr. Hutchens and I are using the same labs but not homework.

Labs and Handouts
If you try to print these pages, they probably
won't print as compactly as the paper copies students receive in class.
Other faculty members are welcome to use and modify the labs.
These are in reverse chronological order (most recent first) for ease of access.

 Debugger lab (do it 11/25)
 Dice Game lab (week of 11/18) 
 Tree Growth lab
 Guess the Number lab
 Diamond and Comments lab
 Weather lab
 Baby Weight homework
 Expr lab
 Coins lab
 Wheels on the Bus homework
 Train lab
 Second part of lab 1
 First part of lab 1
 Syllabus

Example Programs From Class
These are
example programs
from class as well as finished lab assignments.
I'll try to remember to update it whenever I add examples to the directory.
They are sorted both alphabetically and in the order developed in class
with the most recent programs first.
They are also available in /grader/katz/examples.

Example Programs From the Text
We will be using Owen Astrachan's 
A Computer Science Tapestry:
Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++.
The textbook has many example programs.
It is a good idea to read, compile, execute, and modify these programs
on your own. To help you do this, the programs are available
here.
They are also available in /grader/katz/tapestryProgs.

Some other Useful Things
These are some additional resources you may find useful.
