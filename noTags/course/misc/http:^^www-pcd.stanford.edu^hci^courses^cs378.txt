CS378. Phenomenological Foundations of Cognition, Language, and Computation


CS378. Phenomenological Foundations of Cognition, Language, and Computation
Stanford University 1995-96
Terry Winograd

(same as Linguistics 237, VTSS 178)
In this course we undertake a critical analysis of the theoretical foundations of cognitive approaches to language, thought and computation.  We contrast the rationalistic assumptions of current linguistics and artificial intelligence with alternatives drawn from phenomenology, theoretical biology, critical literary theory, and socially-oriented speech act theory.  The material emphasizes the relevance of theoretical orientation to the design, implementation, and impact of computer systems, especially as it affects human-computer interaction.

3-4 units, Th 1:15-4:05, Gates Hall 104 (NEW LOCATION)
