 CS51 Project Book 
 The Computer Science 51
 Project Book 
is an informal text book for the course maintained by volunteers. 

This is a compressed version of the postscript file. Feel free to
download it and print it in the science center. However, we recommend
that you purchase a printed and bound copy from the SourceBook
Center in the basement of the Science Center. I tried printing
this once and it took hours. Plus, I had to hole punch the 
hardcopy  myself- that ate up an afternoon! My book was also twice 
as bulky because I did not want to fiddle with printing double sided. 
Make life easy: buy the book!



  Lisp Links  


We will try to place interesting LISP related materials in this section.


  clisp for Linux. This is 
	a user-friendly common lisp implementation that many of
	the TFs prefer on their own systems. For special instructions
	on how to install this if you are using ELF binaries, 
	consult this.

	 LISP Faq
 Online COMMON LISP manual You can
	     search this file for descriptions of the COMMON LISP
	     functions and macros.

	 CS51 LISP Style Guide. [
	Word7.0, postscript] 


  SPIM Links  

Michael Barrientos has kindly contributed 
instructions on
how one can properly configure SPIM to run on Linux machines.
