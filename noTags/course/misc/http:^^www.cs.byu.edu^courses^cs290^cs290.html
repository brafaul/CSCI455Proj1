Grading:
  See the grading scheme.

Homework Assignments
There will be two homework assignments early in the term.

Homework 1: Unix proficiency exercises.
 Homework 2: ``Hello, world''.


Programming Assignments
There will be four programming assignments throughout the term.
Your progams must conform to the 
CS 290 Style Guide.  Asking questions of the
TA and other students is fine, but you must do the actual writing of your
program yourself, and must understand what you are doing.

Program #1: Rectangle
Program #2: Guessing game
Program #3: Functions
Program #4: Classes

See the pass-off instructions for help on
submitting your completed assignment.
Late Penalties
Late programs and homework will lose 50% of the total possible points, so do
your work early and don't get behind.

Backups
Backup often.  You can create a backup directory to put things in, or you can
use ftp to transfer files to a PC, Mac, or alternate UNIX account.  If you
lose your program and don't have a backup there will be little sympathy
shown. You can backup files to an IBM PC-formatted floppy using the
DOS Interchange Format commands.
