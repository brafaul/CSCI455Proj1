Each lecture is organized as follows: The link marked "Lecture[#]" is a
file which will give you the slides from the class in .html format. The same
information is available in ".ps" and a "short ps" formats (links marked
in square brackets: [ps, short ps]). The ps link will give you the exact
copies of the slides and short ps link will give four slides formatted
in one page. However, to be able to see the .ps files, you must ensure
that your browser has post script viewing ability.
