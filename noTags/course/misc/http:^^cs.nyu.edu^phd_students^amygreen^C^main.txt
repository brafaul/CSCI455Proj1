The intent of this project is to build a cryptographic system which
encrypts plaintext and decrypts ciphertext, possibly using a keyword.
The system may utilize the transposition cipher, the Vigenere
cipher, the Playfair cipher, or any original variants of these
ciphers.  See the cryptography
slides for detailed descriptions of these ciphers.


No late projects will be accepted.

Midterm Exam
Tuesday, October 22, 4:00 - 5:20 p.m.
[html]

The midterm consists of 8 questions for a total value of 200 points
In general, the questions are of the form:
given a program, what is the output?
In addition, several questions ask you to write
short segments of code

The first two questions are short answer, just like the quiz
The next three questions cover
if/else and switch statements
The sixth question covers for and while loops
And the last two questions are program traces
