 Course Description 
 
The purpose of this course is to enhance the student's abilities
in object-oriented analysis and design. Although the course will
use C++ as a target language, the course will involve only
minor programming in C++.  This is not a course in C++ and
knowledge of C++ is not a prerequisite.  Contact dag@cis.ksu.edu
if you have questions.


The required text for the course is Object-Oriented Modeling and 
Design by James Rumbaugh, etal. Prentice-Hall, c1991.
A supplemental text is C++, The Complete Reference by 
Herbert Schildt (2nd edition), Osbourne Publishing c1995.



The course will include two lectures per week (MW 2:30PM)
and an interactive session over electronic mail/internet 
each week (T 8:00PM-10:00PM).
There will be homework, weekly assignments, 2 presentations,
2 midterms, and a final.
This course is offered on campus and off campus through compressed
video and/or video tapes.
