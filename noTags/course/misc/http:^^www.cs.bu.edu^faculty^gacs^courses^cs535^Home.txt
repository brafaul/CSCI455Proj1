Description
  Topics covered:
  Machine models.  Undecidability.  Complexity notions.  Some
important algorithms.  Compression and speed-up theorems.
Nondeterminism.  NP problems.  Randomized algorithms.  Prime number
tests.  Description complexity, randomness, information.
Pseudorandom generators.  Quadratic residuosity, and public-key
cryptography.  Parallel algorithms.  Exponential lower bounds,
alternating machines and games.  Decision trees.  Communication
complexity.
 

Homework
  Homework:
  Given every Tuesday.  Must be returned next Tuesday.  50% credit if
late by one class period, no credit thereafter.
  Each student can get at most one exception for not submitting homework on
time.

 Exams
  One midterm (one class period length) and one final exam.
  Only a single double-sided sheet of handwritten notes
("crib-sheet") is allowed.
  The final exam covers the whole material.

 Grading
  In the final grade, your homeworks count 30% and your exams 30% and 40%.
  An Incomplete grade will only be given in exceptional circumstances.

 Cooperation
  It is OK to discuss the homework with your classmates, but you must write
it up yourself and understand it.
  I will ask questions if the solution is suspicious.
