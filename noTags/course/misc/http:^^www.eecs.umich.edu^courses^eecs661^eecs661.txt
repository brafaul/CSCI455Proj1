EECS 661:  Discrete Event Systems
EECS 661:  Discrete Event Systems

Welcome to the EECS 661 web page!


For the Fall 1996 offering of this course, this homepage is maintained
by the instructor (Professor St√©phane Lafortune),
with the help of John Chay.


EECS 661 is offered EVERY OTHER YEAR in the fall semester.
It is intended for EECS graduate students who  want to learn
about the modeling, analysis and control of
``discrete event dynamical systems'' (DES).
These are dynamical systems that have discrete state spaces
and event-driven dynamics.
DES arise in the modeling of technological systems
such as automated manufacturing systems, computer systems,
and communication networks.


Futher information is available in the following documents.
