The code we will review Thursday Oct 3 is
in file ~cs130a/files/llist.C
You may one to see the one used last year
which does the same thing but in a slightly
different way.  That program is in file
~cs130a/files/95llist.C
 

Copy them into your directory and type:
g++ llist.C
 

then type
a.out
 

Sample input (one number per line):
6
7
5
4
3
0
7
6
8
9
1
2
3
0

You may use the listitarator class for the hw, as long
as it results in a time efficient procedure
as without it, (time efficient with respect to O notation).

 
For problem two if you do insert(s), insert(s+1), ... insert(f)
results in very inefficient code.  So just implement the operation
directly .

 
Remember, we want time efficient code, but do not try to optimize to the
last bit (i.e., do not try to reduce to the last bit the constant "c"
in the O notation for the time complexity).

Typo in Hw: In the sorting algorithm (problem 6d)
       replace if (count == 0)
            by if (count != 0)

Comments on the project:

(1)    Use g++

(2)    Note that k is either zero or it is a positive integer >= 2

(3)    Typos ( replace "retured" by "returned",
replace "occurence" by "occurance",
replace "occurences" by "occurances",
replace "ingnore" by "ignore",
replace "clases" by "classes". )

(4)
An example for the project is in ~cs130a/files/example

Comments on the project:

The root node in both figures should have a 9 instead of an 8

Just called the RBR and they said the old midterms for cs130a
are there.  If they are not listed, then ask the person in the counter
directly.

As we said in the first handout: you must work in the project
(and homeworks) individually.


As I said before in the project, my member functions should
not be your final memeber functions.  The purpose of the functions
is to give examples on how to acceess the data.  However the data
in the nodes should be left untouched.


In the project handout (page 6) I say that x is followed by a CR.
I should have said that x is followed by a CR or a blank.
The same holds for string y. 
A little C++ program to read data is in file ~cs130a/files/read.C

In the project I say that when a ArrayTrieNode or a LinkedTrieNode
has a count that becomes 1 it should become a TinyTrieNode.
That is INCORRECT (sorry about that).  It becomes a TinyTrieNode
when in addition to the count being 1 the StrEnds is TRUE.

The homeworks have been graded.  You can pick them
up during my office hours today from 1-2.  
 

The solutions are in the RBR.  They are also in
the file ~cs130a/files/hw1.ps
  

You can print that file or view it with ghostscript hw1.ps
The press the left bottom on the dismiss sign if it appears.
Put the mouse insede the window and type CR to advance the page.
Additional information on ghostview appears when you type 
man hw1.ps
 
 

In the hw it should say that Bogdan Cocosel is a co-author
of the solutions.

Oops!!  I forgot to add this.  But here it is.
In the file ~cs130a/files/proj.C and the
file ~cs130a/files/projh.C you will find code
to access and create the two examples in the project
handout.  You can copy them into your directory,
compile it and run it.

As we say in the project description we are dealing with sets, so
we do not keep multiple copies of the same word in the same set.
Also, the input is ERROR FREE. But one might try to insert
a word in a set that is already there or delete a word that
is not in a set.  In the first case you must not insert the word and
the count needs to remain unchanged.  In the second case, the count must
remain unchanged and nothing must be deleted.  Note that this is important
to facilitate testing.


If you implement insert as in the class
notes, you will have to make to passes
over the Trie in some cases. Either to 
update the count when inserting a new word, or
"unupdating" the count if it was updated incorrectly
because the word was already there.
 

You can create a member function whoami (defined like
GetNext) to return the type of object you have for derived
classes (like TinyTrieNode, etc.).
 


***************************

***************************
 

Remember that the final type of a node DEPENDS on the
NUMBER OF WORDS in that subtree  It DOES NOT depend on the number of nodes
or the number of nonnull pointers in that subtree.

The Office hours of the TAs on Wednesday and Friday will be in CSIL
from now till December.


If you would like CSIL to be open during the Thankgiving Holidays,
please send e-mail to humphrey@cs.  It would be nice if you
specify the times and days you want it be open, and if you would
like to "babysit" the machines.
