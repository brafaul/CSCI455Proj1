Catalog Description

CSE 1001.
An introduction to software development as it applies to small programs. Students learn to program in a
higher-level language and will learn to read, understand, write and evolve typical small-higher-level
programs. 

Course Goals

In this class we expect students to learn

what makes up computer science,
  how to write simple programs in the Ada programming language, and
  how to solve problems using a computer

This class has no prerequisites.


Another document gives a more detailed list
of topics to be covered in this class.


Students often come with a wide variety of backgrounds and
vastly different experience.
As a consequence some students may be bored and some may be lost.
Your patience, support of your classmates,
and participation in class are appreciated.

Textbook

The textbook for this class is the

Nell Dale, Chip Weems, and John McCormick.
Programming and Problem Solving with Ada.
D. C. Heath, Lexington, Massachusetts, 1994.
ISBN 0-669-29360-1.

We will follow the book quite closely.
We expect to cover all the chapters in the text up to 12.
If time permits, we may cover some additional material.


The book comes with a diskette containing all the Ada programs
appearing in the book;
the programs are also available on the WWW (see below).

Information on the net


Ada95: Simplified Syntax defines a basic
      portion of the language corresponding roughly to the portion of Ada covered in cse1001.
  Ada 95 Language Reference Manual.
      A hypertext version of the
      revised international standard (ISO/IEC 8652:1995)
      Information Technology--Programming Languages--Ada.
  Ada 95 Rationale
FAQ.
      Frequently Asked Questions about Ada.
  Ada Core Technologies developers of
      the GNU Ada Translator (GNAT);
      How to use the GNAT [local copy; 73K bytes]
ada-mode for Emacs
  aimap Perl script for case of identifers
  How to run GNAT on Tuck
Ada Information Clearinghouse Home Page
The special interest group on Ada has a WWW page World Wide Web Home Page for ACM SIGAda
      that contains information about SIGAda and
      pointers to other source of information about Ada
      including Ada Related Jobs
Information about Augusta Ada Bryan
The
      programs
      appearing in Programming and Problem Solving with Ada
      by Dale, Weems, and McCormick.
      Also a local, old copy of the
      programs.

  An Ada IDE
      (224K), a graphical IDE for the Windows 95/NT port of the GNAT Ada 95 compiler. This is
      released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and includes Borland Delphi 2.0 source
      code. 



How to get an Ada Compiler

You do not need to get an Ada compiler;
will be using the GNAT compiler and it is available both in the CS PC lab (S 332),
and by anyone with an account on tuck.cs.fit.edu.


If you would like your own Ada compiler,
and you have a (large and fast) computer,
the GNAT compiler is free.
Down-load the distribution from the
Ada Core Technologies WWW Page.

Programming Style

A lengthy and detailed document available on the WWW
http://www.cs.fit.edu/~ryan/ada83-style.txt
 gives specific and sensible advice about writing clear Ada programs.
You should at all times heed their advice.
No Ada program will be considered completely correct unless it
is a model of clarity and good style.
A shorter extract from this document will be handed out in lab.


A lengthy and detailed guide for the development of
well-constructed programs in general can be found in the following book. 
It is full of practical advice
and examples of bad and good program fragments mostly in C and Pascal.

Steve McConnell.
Code Complete.
Microsoft Press, Redmond, Washington, 1993.
ISBN 1-55615-484-4.


Classwork

In addition to the lab projects,
there will be three in-class midterm examinations
and a final.
You are encouraged to read the textbook in preparation
for class and to work the exercises at the end of
the chapters.

Grading

There will be three midterms and a final in the class.
Lab projects will count 45% of the total grade.
Each midterm will count 10% and the final 25%.
Each exam and lab project will be assigned a numeric score.
The average numeric score
is roughly equivalent to a B- letter grade.
The letter grade for the class will be assigned to each student
based on the weighted sum of these numeric scores.
Your grade is determined by how you do relatively to the rest
of the class,
not by the magnitude of your numeric scores.


All work is to be your own.
On tests, be sure to explain your answers as if you were
tutoring someone else.





For each student the
numeric scores for the lab
assignments and exams are recorded.
If you have any question about your standing in the class,
or if some score has been recorded wrong,
please contact me immediately.
Corrections will not be made long after the due dates.

Grade distribution

In the past the grade distribution has looked like this:

     Fall 1994   Fall 1995
  A     5 15%      12 25% 
  B    11 32%      18 38%
  C    10 29%      12 25%
  D     4 12%       3  6%
  F     5 15%       3  6%
       ------      ------
       34          48

Quote by E. W. Dijkstra


We now know that a programmable computer is no more and
no less than an extremely handy device for realizing
any conceivable mechanism without changing a single wire,
and that the core challenge for computing science is hence a conceptual one,
viz. what (abstract) mechanisms we can conceive without getting
lost in the complexities of our own making.


E. W. Dijkstra,
"On a Cultural Gap,"
The Mathematical Intelligencer,
volume 8, number 1, 1998, page 49.
