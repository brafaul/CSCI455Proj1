CS 835 - Seminar on Networked Computing Systems

CS 835 - Seminar on Networked Computing Systems 
Fall 1996

Instructors: Professors 

Almeida,

Bestavros,

Crovella, and

Yates.
Time: Monday 1-3 pm
Location: MCS B46
Credit: May be taken as audit, or for up to 4 credits

Course Description

This seminar will take a hands-on approach to examining the design of
current networked computing systems.  In particular we will adopt as our
case study the software system associated with a World Wide Web server.
The course will consist of code walk-throughs and lectures.  Code
walk-throughs will include: at the kernel level
(namely in Linux),
the network, file system,
and process scheduling functions; and at the application level,
one Web server (Apache).
Lectures will cover research issues in server design,
performance modeling, and simulation techniques.  This seminar will
be a prerequisite or corequisite for participating in the Commonwealth
Server Project, which is being led by the instructors; however any
student who is interested in studying the implementation of a
networked computer system is invited to attend.  We will be asking
attendees to be notetakers for a week.  As a notetaker,
your job is to keep track of the main themes of the 
discussion and any interesting
points made by any of the participants.



Participation in this seminar is by encouragement/consent
of one of the instructors.
Students taking this course for credit will be expected to complete a
related project chosen in consultation with one of the instructors.  The
project cannot serve also as a Master's project, however, if a two-phase
proposal is accepted by the instructor the second phase can serve as a MS
project.  Students may form teams to work on projects, however, the project
scope must scale linearly with the team size, and work must be explicitly
load balanced in a fair way.  It's also OK to take this course for no
credit, but to use it to lead on to an MS project during a subsequent
semester.



We will schedule a brownbag (or two) at the end of the semester.
Each
student participating will be asked to talk for a short
time (10 mins) on their project or on a related topic.

Course Schedule

Here's the proposed week-by-week schedule of topics we'd like to cover.
During weeks 5 through 9 our code walkthroughs will take us through version
2.0.10 of the Linux kernel
(see 
linux-2.0.10/ under
/sw/course/cs835-f96/).
During weeks 10 and 11 our code walkthroughs will be through
version 1.1.1 of the Apache server
(see
apache_1.1.1/ in the same place).
If you're a presenter or a scribe for a particular week,
please mail your notes
to djy@cs.bu.edu so that they can be linked to this home
page.
