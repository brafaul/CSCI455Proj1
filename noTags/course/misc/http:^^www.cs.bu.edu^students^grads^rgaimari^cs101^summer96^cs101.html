CS-101: Introduction to Computers


 

CS 101 is a general introduction to computers and their applications
that assumes no previous knowledge of the subject. CS101 introduces 
computers and their uses in the arts and sciences -- what they are,
how they work, how they can be programmed, what they can and cannot
do. It is for people who read about such topics as microprocessors or
the WWW and want to understand them, for people who need to have data
processed on the job, and for people who see the computerization of
our society and ask about the meaning of it all.
