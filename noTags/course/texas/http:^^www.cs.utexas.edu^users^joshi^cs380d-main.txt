Mechanics

I expect that 2/3 of the classes will cover material from the required
textbook; the remainder will come from other sources (i.e. papers,
other textbooks). References to such sources will be given in class
at the appropriate time.

Lectures: 9:00-10:30 Monday and Wednesday, in Robert Lee Moore Hall
5.124.

The newsgroup for the class is
utexas.class.cs380d.


Required Textbook

 Distributed Systems, Second Edition, S. Mullender (editor), ACM
Press, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading MA, 1994.


Course Content

CS380 covers abstractions that have proved useful or are expected to
be useful for designing and building tomorrow's distributed
systems. These include:
 global states (cuts, logical and vector clocks, causal message
delivery, global property detection)
 message logging and checkpointing
 replication management (state machine approach, primary backup
approach)
 agreement protocols (Byzantine agreement, ordered multicast)
 group programming (techniques and applications)
 distributed file systems (caching, disconnected operations)
 time services (Byzantine clock synchronization, NTP)
 security (encryption, authentication, security in group programming)


We will integrate the discussion of the general principles with the
presentation of case studies that exemplify how such principles
have been used to design and implement  real systems.
Other topics, depending on time and interest, will be presented by me
or by some of you (the size of the class does not allow all of you to give a
presentation). Such topics  may include:
 distributed shared memory
 distributed objects
 kernel support for distributed systems
 weak consistency for replica management
 protocols for electronic commerce
 protocols for wide-area networks


Grading

There will be 4 or 5 written homework assignment. Solutions will be
graded F, B, or A. Any solution that demonstrates a credible effort on
behalf of its authors (whether the solution is right or wrong) will
receive a B or better.

Collaboration on homework assignment by up to three students is
permitted and encouraged, but not required. When there is such a
collaboration, a single solution should be submitted for
grading, with the names of the collaborators. Other collaborations
will be considered violations of Academic Integrity.

There will be a written, take-home midterm examination, for which no
collaboration will be allowed.

There will be no final exam. Each student however will be required to
write a final paper (about 20 pages) that surveys one of the issues
that we have discussed in class. A list of suggested topics will be
distributed in class on Monday 4/8. The paper is due at the start of
the last class, Wednesday 5/1: hence, you will have 4 weeks to
complete the paper.

You can also team up with a colleague and prepare one or two
lectures on a topic not previously covered in class. If you choose
this option, you and your colleague will only be required to write a
single survey paper of about 20 pages. I warmly encourage you to
consider volunteering for a presentation: it will give you an excellent
opportunity to improve your communication skills.


Problem Sets

In this and all subsequent problem sets, you should
conform to the following general guidelines:
 ``Prove'' and ``show'' are synonymous. A precise proof is
required when you are asked to ``prove'' or ``show'' something.
 To show that something is impossible, you have to give a proof that
makes it clear that the problem cannot be solved, no matter what the algorithm
is. It is insufficient to show that a particular algorithm does not work.
 Any algorithm that you develop must be accompanied by a proof of
correctness, unless you explicitly told otherwise.



 Due: Mon, 5 Feb 1996
Problem 1
 The snapshot protocols discussed in class and in the
textbook assume that communication channels are FIFO. Derive a
snapshot protocol for an asynchronous system that does not depend on
the FIFO assumption, and prove it correct (i.e. prove that the
protocol produces a consistent global state). You may assume that at
most one snapshot is being computed at any point during a run. 
 Note: The book contains a reference to a paper by Mattern that
contains a solution to the problem. I urge you to resist the
temptation to solve the problem by visiting the library...

Problem 2
 Taking the snapshot of a distributed computation is a
general technique for computing stable global predicates. More
efficient protocols can be derived for computing specific predicates,
that are often conceptually simpler and more efficient (in terms of
the number of messages they exchange) than a snapshot-based solution.

In this problem you are required to derive such a ``specialized''
protocol for detecting a deadlock in an asynchronous distributed
system. Ideally, your protocol would not need a centralized monitor
process, and would have a message cost of O(n), where n
is the number of processes in the distributed system (a monitor-based
snapshot protocol for detecting deadlock has a cost of O(n*n)).

The suggested solutions to these problems are now
online.  This link points to the postscript file.
