 Course Description


 General Information

 Course Title:  CS380L: Advanced Operating Systems 
 Instructor: bf Professor Harrick Vin  
 Last Offered:  Fall 1994


 Prerequisite

Graduate standing and an undergraduate course in operating systems
such as CS 372. Students are expected to be familiar with the material
in chapters 1-12 of "Operating Systems Concepts" by Peterson and
Silberschatz.


 Synopsis

CS 380L is a breadth course in advanced operating systems covering
both theoretical and practical issues in operating system
design. Topics to be covered include design and implementation of
distributed and real-time operating systems, system support for
mobile/wireless computing environments, and some case studies. An
emphasis will be placed on current design issues and research topics.


 Textbook(s)

A collection of research articles will be made available by the
instructor.


 Course Requirements

Students will be required to read a number of papers in the area and
discuss them. Grades will be determined by two examinations (50%), a
term project (40%), and project presentation (10%).
