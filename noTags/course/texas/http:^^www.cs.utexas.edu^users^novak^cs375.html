CS 375: Compilers


CS 375: Compilers


CS 375 covers the design and construction of compilers for programming
languages.  Each student writes a compiler for most of Pascal; code
is generated for the PowerPC processor and is run on an IBM RS/6000
server that incorporates the PowerPC chip.

This course has a heavy programming workload, especially in the summer.
Students planning to take the course in summer should expect to dedicate
their lives to this course for five weeks.
