 Course Description

 General Information

 Course Title:   CS395T: Multimedia Communication and Databases  
 Instructor:   Professor Harrick M. Vin  
 Semester:   Fall 1995  
 Meeting Time:   Friday 10:00 - 1:00, TAY 3.144  
 Prerequisites

Graduate standing, familiarity with basic concepts in network
protocols and operating system design, and the CS395T: Multimedia
Systems course.

 Synopsis

This is an advanced course in multimedia systems. Topics to be
discussed in this course include: transport protocol design for
multimedia, routing and multicasting, mobile networking and
multimedia, operating system support for multimedia, and multimedia
databases. An emphasis will be placed on current design issues and
research topics.

 Textbook(s)

A collection of research articles will be made available by the
instructor.

 Course Requirements

Students will be required to read a number of papers in the area as
well as present and discuss them in class. Grades will be determined
based on paper presentations and class participation. Students
enrolling for a letter grade will be required to submit a paper and/or
carry out a project.
