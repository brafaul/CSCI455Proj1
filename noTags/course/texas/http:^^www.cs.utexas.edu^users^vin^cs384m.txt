Prerequisites

Graduate standing and familiarity with basic concepts in
computer networks and operating system design.


Synopsis

CS 384M is a course in advanced systems covering both
theoretical and practical issues in designing multimedia
systems. Topics to be covered include introduction to multimedia
systems, digital video compression techniques, operating system
support for digital audio and video, as well as network and transport
protocols for multimedia. An emphasis will be placed on current design
issues and research topics.


Textbook

A collection of recent research articles will be made
available by the instructor.


Course Requirements

The instructor will introduce basic concepts on each of the
topics. This will be followed by in-class discussions on related
papers in a question-answer format. Students will be expected to
understand, describe, and critique the research contributions of
papers. Additionally, each student will be expected to carry out a
semester-long implementation project.

Grades will be determined by a project, examinations, and
class participation.
