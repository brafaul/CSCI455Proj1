  Homework 1  - If you 
        don't have the textbook yet, here is the   
        ciphertext for problem 10  .   Notice:  the answer to the 
        last problem is in French .  You should be able to recognize the 
        French as the word  "Canada"  appears.  The frequency of
        the most common letters in French should not change too 
        drastically from English; however, digrams like "th" will not 
        appear.
