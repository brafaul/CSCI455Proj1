Important Announcements 

 
I am taking off today (12/11) for home. So I will be unable to maintain this page for
these last couple of days. However, I am putting this  link  to Dr.
Porter's page and all class related announcement (if any) will be available by following it. Good Luck
for the Finals! 

Next week, there will be special classes for reviewing some of the important topics
 covered in class. All classes will be held in Painter hall. The exact location will depend
on room availibity. However, notes will be posted on doors and the office and there
will be someone in the office (PAI 3.06) to inform you. The timing are posted below. Moreover, there will be almost
 total coverage for next week by office hrs. of TAs and Dr. Porter, right upto
the time of the final exam. So, if you need any help, feel free to come by and ask
 one of us; we will be glad to help. Good Luck for the Finals!

Question #7 on the review sheet (the one on rotating bits) can be disregarded; it is 
somewhat beyond the scope of what we covered in class. 
The slides presented in lecture on December 5th (summarizing the
contents of the whole semester) are available at the reserve desk at
UGL. We hope to post them on the webpage soon, but we are experiencing 
some technical difficulties caused by the length of the file.
