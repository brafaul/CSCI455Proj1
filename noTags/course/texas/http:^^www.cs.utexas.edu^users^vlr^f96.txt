 FINAL EXAM UPDATES:


Here are my responses to all questions I have received so far.
(The questions posed are in quotes.)




``Problem 1 a) the last sentence " ... takes more time on sigma' than on
sigma." What does the word "time" refer? Amortized time ot Total time or
others?''


ANSWER: Total time.



``Problem 1 ) well-known faces: 
Any data structure for disjoint sets requires Big-Omega(ma(m,n)) time in
the worst case, but in our text book it is Big-O, not Big-Omega, is
there any difference?''


 ANSWER: I meant Big-Omega (see the first sentence of the second paragraph
of the Chapter notes on p. 461).



``Problem 4) the last sentence: "... no two vertices on the cycle contain
distinct labels from the same Li?" , so two vertices on the cycle can
contain same labels , right?''


 ANSWER: Right.



``I think the problem 3 in the final exam is a little unclear. 
Does f(X) denote the size of the largest true k x k submatrix or the 
size of the largest true l x m submatrix of X, where l does not have 
to equal to m?''


 ANSWER: A submatrix of X is "true" only if it is k x k for some
k and all of its k^2 entries are true.
