 Course blurb: There are many approaches to formal reasoning.  The
objective of specifying computer programs, including the formalization
of worlds with which programs are to interact, has led to the creation
of numerous tools for formal reasoning.  We will examine some systems
for formal reasoning while examining a number of mechanical formal
methods tools that support these different systems.  Examples of such
system/tool pairs are: 

 

 System                           Tool
				
 Primitive Recursive Arithmetic   Boyer-Moore Prover, ACL2
 First Order Logic                Otter, Nelson's qed
 Higher Order Logic               HOL, IMPS
 Equational Reasoning             OBJ
 Set Theory                       Mizar, Quaife/Otter, PVS
 Type Theory                      NuPrl, Lego, Coq



Students will choose, with the help of the instructor, a system and/or
tool to examine and the grade will be based upon presentations about
these.

Bowen' Formal Methods Web Page and a 
backup copy.



The chief assignment.  Select a formal methods system, e.g.,
from Bowen's Formal Methods Web Page above, and report via in-class,
oral presentations on either its logical foundations or upon its use.
Many of these systems have good, freely available implementations.
Consult with me before making a final choice.

No tests, no final.  Only the presentation(s).

I hope to have a number of guest presentations from the local
formal methods community.
