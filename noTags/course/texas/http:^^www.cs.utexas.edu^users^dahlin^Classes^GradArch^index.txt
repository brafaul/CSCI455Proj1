CS382M: Advanced Computer Architecture



CS382M: Advanced Computer Architecture
This course focuses on the techniques of quantitative analysis and evaluation
of modern computing systems, such as the selection of appropriate benchmarks
to reveal and compare the performance of alternative design choices in
system design. The emphasis is on the major component subsystems of high
performance computers: pipelining, instruction level parallelism, memory
hierarchies, input/output, and network-oriented interconnections. Students
will undertake a major computing system analysis and design project of
their own choosing.
