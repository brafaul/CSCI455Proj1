 CONTEST
         In this contest, I run all MDBs on my benchmark ( a DML script and
         3 raw data files: emp.data, 
         student.data, 
	 dept.data ). 
         /usr/bin/time was used to measure the running time.
         Since the order of tuples and attributes in each tuple may be
	 different from one output to another, I wrote a 
         Perl script to
	 transform different outputs into the same order so that I can compare 
         (/usr/bin/diff) them. It turns out that 
         10 programs passed the
	 benchmark without any error. Other programs failed to pass for
	 some reasons. You can test it by yourself, here's a 
         sample output.
