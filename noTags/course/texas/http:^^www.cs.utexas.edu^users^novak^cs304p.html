CS 304P: Foundations of Computer Science


CS 304P: Foundations of Computer Science


CS 304P is an introduction to Computer Science and programming.

This section of CS 304P is intended for CS majors who have had at
least a semester of programming in high school; the course number will
be changed to CS 306 next year.  If you have never taken a programming
course before, you should take Porter's section of CS 304P instead.
A strong math background, at least through precalculus, is required.

We will use the programming language Scheme, a dialect of Lisp.  The
Scheme implementation we will use is called Gambit and runs on Macintosh
computers.

This course will move faster than the previous CS 304P courses
and will emphasize CS concepts more than programming language syntax.
We will do a lot of programming and work hard, while hopefully learning
a lot and having fun.
