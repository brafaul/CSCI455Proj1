Lloyd N. Trefethen
Professor
LNT@cs.cornell.edu


My appointment at Cornell is in the
Computer Science Department.
I am also affiliated with the
Center for Applied Mathematics,
the Department of Mathematics,
and the
Cornell Theory Center.

My field is numerical analysis / scientific computing; I have
a personal view of what this means.
Specific interests include numerical linear algebra, numerical
solution of PDE, numerical conformal mapping, approximation theory,
and fluid mechanics.  In recent years much of my work has
been related to non-normal matrices and operators, that is,
matrices and operators whose eigenvectors are not
orthogonal, and applications.

Textbooks

Finite Difference and Spectral Methods (ODE/PDE textbook)
Numerical Linear Algebra (textbook by Trefethen and Bau, SIAM, 1997)

Recent papers
