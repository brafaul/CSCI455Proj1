Research Interests

My primary research interests are in the development and use of
advanced programming languages.  I am particularly interested
in the use of high-level languages, such as Standard ML, for
building systems software, including run-time systems, operating
systems, and distributed systems.  Lately, I have focused on
the implementation issues that have kept high-level, safe
languages from being used in the construction of systems software.
To this end, my research has concentrated on producing code for high-level 
languages that is faster, consumes less memory, and supports
"hacking with the bits".  

I am also interested in bringing powerful, semantics-based tools
from programming language theory, such as type-directed compilation,
partial evaluation, abstract interpretation, and run-time code generation,
into the design, specification, and construction of real systems
software.
