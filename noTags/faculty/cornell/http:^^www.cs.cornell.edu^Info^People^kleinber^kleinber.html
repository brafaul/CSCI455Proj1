My research interests are in algorithms and combinatorial optimization,
with an emphasis on approximation, computational geometry, 
network optimization and distributed computing, and 
algorithms in molecular biology.
Recent work has included
 approximation algorithms for routing and
disjoint paths problems in networks;
 adversarial queueing theory, an approach to analyzing the stability
of network routing protocols without probabilistic assumptions;
 geometric methods in combinatorial optimization, particularly
the use of positive semi-definite programming; and
 geometric algorithms for studying molecular conformation.

I am spending the 1996-97 academic year visiting the 
IBM Almaden 
Research Center.
