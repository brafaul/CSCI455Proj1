We continue to develop new methods for various Kronecker product 
computations.  In particular, we have a method for solving the nearest 
Kronecker product problem when the factor matrices are subjected to 
inhomogeneous constraints.  Some applications in signal processing and 
Markov processes are solved as a result.  Kronecker product descriptions 
for various fast wavelet transforms have also been derived.  Our aim is to 
proceed by analogy to the FFT, where such descriptions have played an 
important role in the development of high-performance algorithms.

Both undergraduate texts on computational science that I have been working 
on for the last four years are now in production.  One is currently being 
translated into C in anticipation of the fall semester.
