Note change in area code effective 8/3/96.

My research interest is numerical analysis.  (You aren't
sure what numerical analysis is?  Please see the 
essay
by my colleague L. N. Trefethen.)
More specifically,
I am interested in:


Numerical optimization and complexity issues

Numerical methods for boundary value problems

Geometric problems arising in scientific computing

Sparse matrix computations


I have a few recent manuscripts available on-line:


S. Vavasis and Y. Ye, ``A primal dual accelerated interior
point method whose running time depends only on A''
(click here)

P. Hough and  S. Vavasis, ``Complete orthogonal decomposition
for weighted least squares''
(click here)

S. Mitchell and S. Vavasis, ``An aspect ratio bound for triangulating a d-grid
cut by a hyperplane''
(click here)

The QMG package

I have recently completed a software project on mesh generation for
the finite element method in three dimensions.  The software package,
called QMG, is available at the source code level by anonymous ftp.
With QMG you can construct polyhedral geometric objects with very
complicated topology (holes, internal boundaries, etc.) and
automatically create an unstructured
tetrahedral mesh for them.  
(The mesh generator is based on algorithmic work by Scott Mitchell and me.)
You can also solve an elliptic boundary
value problem (div (c*grad u)=0) on your domain.  The package is
written in C++ and Matlab and is distributed
for free at the source-code level (anonymous ftp distribution
began 5/5/95). 

QMG 1.1 was released on 20 November 1996.  QMG1.1 features many
improvements over QMG1.0, including a faster mesh generation algorithm,
VRML graphics, much cleaner C++ code, a boundary mesh generation algorithm,
compatibility with Microsoft Windows NT as well as Unix, and compatibility
with Tcl/Tk as well as Matlab.
