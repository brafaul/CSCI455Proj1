Techniques for understanding concurrent programs are becoming increasingly 
important as distributed computing systems become widespread in 
mission-critical applications.  My research has focused on the development 
of these techniques.

I have been heavily involved in applying assertional reasoning to the 
design of concurrent, distributed, fault-tolerant, and real-time programs.  
I am completing a textbook on this subject.  Along with David Gries, I 
continue investigations concerning our first-order equational logic E.  
This past year, we streamlined the inference rules and evaluated a number 
of techniques for handling undefined terms and partial functions.

Thomas Bressoud and I completed building and analyzing our hypervisor-based 
implementation of replication management for HP's PA-RISC architecture.  
Our protocols ensure that the sequence of instructions executed by two 
virtual machines running on different physical processors are identical.  
The protocols also coordinate I/O issued by these virtual machines.  Use of 
a hypervisor to implement replica coordination is attractive - at least, in 
theory.  When replica coordination is implemented in a hypervisor, it 
instantly becomes available to all hardware realizations of the given 
instruction-set architecture, including realizations that did not exist 
when the hypervisor was written.  Second, when replica coordination is 
implemented in a hypervisor, a single implementation suffices for every 
operating system that executes on that instruction-set architecture.  
Finally, by implementing replica coordination in a hypervisor, the 
applications programmer is freed from this task.

Jointly with Dag Johansen (University of Tromsø, Norway) and Robbert van 
Renesse, I started the TACOMA project (Tromsø And COrnell Moving Agents) to 
investigate support and use of mobile processes in building 
mission-critical applications.  By structuring a system in terms of agents, 
applications can be constructed in which communication-network bandwidth is 
conserved.  Data may be accessed only by an agent executing at the same 
site as the data resides.  An agent typically will filter or otherwise 
reduce the data it reads, carrying with it only the relevant information as 
it roams the network.  Two TACOMA prototypes have been completed, and we 
are implementing a third system based on our experiences.

Finally, I developed with Scott Stoller a new algorithm for detecting 
whether a particular computation of an asynchronous distributed system 
could have passed through a global state satisfying some given state 
predicate.  The new algorithm allows more efficient detection than is 
possible with previous algorithms.
