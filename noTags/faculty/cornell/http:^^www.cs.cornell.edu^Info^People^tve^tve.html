Projects

The U-Net architecture
provides a user-level network interface
for clusters of workstations. It offers low-latency
and high-bandwidth communication over high-speed LANs. The current
implementation uses Sun Workstations interconnected by ATM.

Active Messages.
Several projects are porting Active Messages to new platforms (including
the U-Net ATM cluster and the IBM SP-2 and extending the model to
non-SPMD programs.

Split-C is a simple extension
to C for parallel computing. Split-C has been ported to several new
platforms, including U-Net, shared memory multprocessors running SVR4, and 
the IBM SP-2.

having to think about it (well, after a few months your passwords
suddenly run out and you have to run to 4119...)
