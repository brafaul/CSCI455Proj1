Research...
My main
        area of research is visual matching and recognition. My
        work in this area ranges from theoretical algorithms
        (using techniques from computational geometry), to
        applications of visual matching in end-to-end systems
        (for remote collaboration, viewing document images over
        wide area networks, video monitoring and target
        recognition). I am also interested in uses of new types
        of electronic documents for communication, remote collaboration
        and education. 

 


� Algorithms for
                comparing geometric structures


� Hausdorff-based methods for visual
                matching and recognition (a C implementation is available)


� Fast
                indexing using an Eigenspace approximation to the Hausdorff fraction
                (a C and Matlab implementation is available)


� Performance evaluation
                and modeling of recognition methods


� Video monitoring, object tracking and identification


� DigiPaper: a highly compact, universally viewable document image format


� CoNote: a system for supporting collaboration with shared documents





Teaching...
Brian
        Smith and I are developing a new course on authoring Web
        documents, CS130, which will be offered for the
        first time in Spring '97. I also teach CS212, an introduction to
        computation and programming, and CS664, a course in computer vision.


Professional Activities...
I work with Xerox PARC on electronic document image
        processing, and am starting a small group investigating
        these problems at Cornell.
        I am program co-chair of CVPR-97, the IEEE conference on
        computer vision and pattern recognition, which will be
        held in San Juan, PR in June 1997.


Other Interests...
Two of my
        favorite non-computer-geek activities are snowboarding
        and mountain biking (but without the
        mtv-extreme-sports-way-too-cool stupid attitude).
