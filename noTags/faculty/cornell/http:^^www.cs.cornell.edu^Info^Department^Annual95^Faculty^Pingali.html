My research group works in the areas of programming languages and compilers 
for parallel architectures.

Our goal is to develop tools for generating parallel code for applications 
programs that deal with large sparse matrices.  Most scientific 
applications involve the numerical solution of partial differential 
equations.  The techniques used almost always produce a system of algebraic 
equations that involve large sparse matrices.  Unfortunately, existing 
compiler technology does a poor job of parallelizing sparse matrix 
programs.  We take a radically different approach to this problem.  Our 
compiler produces parallel sparse-matrix programs from sequential 
dense-matrix programs, using information from the user about the sparsity 
structure of matrices in the program.  This enables us to use tools from 
the restructuring compiler area.  Preliminary experiments with some Krylov 
space solvers show that the code produced by our compiler is competitive 
with hand-parallelized code in libraries like Argonne's PetSc library.  We 
will extend our approach to direct methods for solving linear systems and 
to applications that require adaptive mesh refinement.

This project builds on our earlier work on restructuring compilation 
techniques for dense matrix programs.  We have developed restructuring 
techniques for compiling programs to distributed memory and non-uniform 
memory access (NUMA) architectures like the IBM SP-2 and CM-5, where a 
processor can access local memory faster than non-local memory.  To get 
good performance, the compiler must not only parallelize but must also 
ensure locality of reference by matching code and data distribution; when 
non-local references must be made, block transfers are preferable to many 
small messages.  We recently developed the best algorithm known for the 
automatic alignment of computation and data and are incorporating it into 
our compiler test-bed.  In earlier work, we developed a novel loop 
restructuring technique called access normalization, which transforms loop 
nests for increased locality and potential for block transfers, and 
implemented it in the LAMBDA loop transformation toolkit - our paper 
summarizing these results won the best paper prize at ASPLOS V.  We worked 
with Hewlett-Packard to transfer this technology to HP's FORTRAN compiler 
product line for uniprocessors and multiprocessors.

We have developed new frameworks for program analysis and optimization 
based on the dependence flow graph (DFG).  The DFG knits together the data 
and control dependence information of a program, permitting the development 
of optimization algorithms that generate better code than is possible with 
competing approaches.  Our results are of independent interest; for 
example, we recently developed optimal algorithms for control dependence 
problems, answering a foundational question that had been open for almost 
a decade.  This work led to the development of a linear-time algorithm for 
computing the static single assignment (SSA) form of programs.  These 
results have been incorporated into a number of compilers, including those 
at IBM, Microsoft, HP, and Flavors.
