Interests
Professor Winograd's focus is on developing the
theoretical background and conceptual models for designing human-computer
interaction.  He is a principal investigator on the Stanford Digital Libraries Project, developing models that can provide information collections and services in an integrated framework from a wide base of heterogeneous distributed materials.  He directs the Project on 
People, Computers, and Design and is developing teaching programs in Human-Computer Interaction Design.


Winograd is a founder of Action Technologies, a developer of workflow software, a regular consultant to Interval Research, and on the national board of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, of which he is a founding member and past president.  He is on the national advisory board of the Association for Software Design and a number of journal editorial boards.
