 Summary of Research
 
My recent research interests mainly focus on three areas:
parallel/distributed computing, software tool/environment
development, and scientific computing.
I and my colleagues in the 
High Performance and Software Lab 
are investigating several research and technical issues into
performance evaluation and system support of
heterogeneous networks of workstations (NOW).
We concentrate on three
problem areas: 1) developing performance metrics and
providing insights into special natures of heterogeneous
distributed computing;
2) providing system support to effectively manage heterogeneity and
scheduling computation tasks across networks;
3) building software tool and environment to aid parallel and distributed
computing and performance evaluation.
Our studies on parallel systems also include several topics of
shared-memory and data-parallel computing.
Our system research is motivated and driven by our studies of
large-scale scientific
applications, such as numerical simulations, nonlinear optimizations and
image processing.
