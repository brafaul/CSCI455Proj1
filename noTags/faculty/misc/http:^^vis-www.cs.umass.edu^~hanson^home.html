 Allen Hanson  received a B.A. degree in electrical engineering from  Clarkson College  in 1964 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from  Cornell University  in 1966 and 1969, respectively.  After appointments at the University of Minnesota and Hampshire College, he joined the Computer Science faculty at the University of Massachusetts in 1981, where he is currently a Professor.


His   research    reflects a broad interest in computer vision and visual information processing, including knowledge-based image understanding, analysis of motion sequences, autonomous vehicle navigation, and parallel architectures for computer vision.  Emphasis on practical systems is supported by research on databases for visual image processing, photo-interpretation of aerial images, biomedical image analysis, automated robotic manufacturing and assembly, real-time control of intelligent vehicles, and development environments for vision research.  He is the author of numerous technical papers and books in these general areas.  With  Prof. Edward Riseman, he is the co-director of the Computer Vision Laboratory and a founder of  Amerinex Artificial Intelligence Corporation and  Dataviews Corporation (formerly VI Corporation), both of which are visual technology oriented companies located in the Amherst, Massachusetts area.

He is a member of the IEEE, ACM, and AAAI and has 
served on the editorial boards of several technical journals.
