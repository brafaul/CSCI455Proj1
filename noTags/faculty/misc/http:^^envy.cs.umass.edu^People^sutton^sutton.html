The long term goal of my research is to identify general computational principles underlying what
we mean by intelligence and goal-directed behavior.  My starting place is the
interaction  between the intelligent agent and its environment.  Goals, choices, and
sources of information are all defined in terms of this interaction.  In some sense it is the
only thing that is real, and from it all our sense of the world is created.  How is this done? 
How can interaction lead to better behavior, better perception, better models of the world?  What
are the computational issues in doing this efficiently and in realtime?  These are the sort of
questions that I ask in trying to understand what it means to be intelligent, to predict and
influence the world, to learn, perceive, act, and think.
