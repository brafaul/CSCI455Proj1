 Research Interests 
     My research is primarily concerned with types of knowledge
representations and processing mechanisms employed in language 
comprehension, especially reading.  Some of this research 
involves computational modeling of the "connectionist" or 
"neural network" type.  The goal of this work is a theory of 
language comprehension that accounts for detailed aspects of 
skilled performance, and can be related to the types of linguistic 
impairments that are observed both developmentally and as a 
consequence of brain injury.  Current work is concerned with a 
model of word recognition in normal and dyslexic reading.
