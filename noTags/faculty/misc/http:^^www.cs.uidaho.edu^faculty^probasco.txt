Music

Before shifting into Computer Science in 1982, I taught in the UI School of 
Music for fourteen years: oboe, music theory and music history.  I
performed in Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, the Rose Bowl, and many of the 
public schools in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.  Every July, I perform in 
the Royal Fireworks Concert in Spokane's Riverfront Park.  
If your smiler needs a tickle, try these  musical instrument jokes. 

If you're ready for more, try these classical music disasters.
