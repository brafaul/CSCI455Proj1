Patrick C. Fischer
Professor of Computer Science
Education

B.S. in Mathematics,
University of Michigan, 1957. 
M.B.A. in Actuarial Science, 
University of Michigan, 1958. 
Ph.D. in Mathematics, 
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1962.

Experience
Dr. Fischer held positions at
Harvard, 
Cornell, the
University of Waterloo
and the
Pennsylvania State University
before assuming
a professorship at Vanderbilt in 1980, where he also served as Chair of
Computer Science
for 15 years.  He has had visiting positions at the
University of British Columbia,
University of California at 
Berkeley,
and
Georgia Institute of Technology.
He has also participated in 3-4 week residencies at the
University of Canterbury,
New Zealand, 
Universit√§t Kaiserslautern,,
Germany, and the
University of Stellenbosch,
South Africa.


Dr. Fischer is the founder of the ACM
Special Interest Group for Algorithms and Computability Theory,
and has held a key position in seven
national symposia.  He has also served the 
Association for Computing Machinery,
in several capacities.  He currently holds positions on the editorial
boards of the

Journal of Computer and System Sciences,
and Computer Languages.

Academic

Dr. Fischer has taught graduate and undergraduate level courses in
databases and has taught courses in automata theory, data structures
and algorithms, computer architecture, discrete structures and computer
programming.  This semester (Fall, 1996) he is teaching
CS 250 - Algorithms   and
CS 265 - Database Management Systems .
In the Spring, 1997, semester he is teaching
CS/Math 212 - Discrete Structures, sections 02 and 03.


Dr. Fischer did research in theoretical computer science until 1972 and has
worked primarily in database theory since then.  He has been interested
in theoretical problems of determining good database design, and in
circumventing some of the limitations of flat relational databases.
He is also interested in database semantics, including metadata and
dealing with incomplete information.


He has published a total of 36 articles in refereed journals, 3 book
chapters, 24 papers in refereed conference proceedings, and has been
co-editor of one book.  Five of his works have been reprinted in
translation.  He has had five grants from NSF and three grants from the
National Research Council of Canada.
He has had 15 students receive their Ph.D. degrees under
his supervision.
