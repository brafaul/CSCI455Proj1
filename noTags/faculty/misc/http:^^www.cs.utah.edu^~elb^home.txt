Professor Brunvand joined the Department of Computer Science in
1990.  He has interests in computer architecture and VLSI systems in
general, and self-timed and asynchronous systems in particular.  One
aspect of his research involves compiling concurrent communicating
programs into asynchronous VLSI circuits. The current system allows
programs written in a subset of occam, a concurrent message-passing
programming language based on CSP, to be automatically compiled into a
set of self-timed circuit modules suitable for manufacture as an
integrated circuit. He is also interested in investigating the effects
of asynchrony on computer systems architecture at a higher level. To
explore these ideas he is building a series of prototype asynchronous
computer systems out of FPGA and custom VLSI chips.

 Asynchronous Circuits Symposia

I was recently involved (as co-general-chair) in organizing the first
International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits
and Systems (Async94) which was held at the University Park Hotel
in Salt Lake City from November 3-5 1994. See the  Async94 home page for more
details.

The 1996 conference, Async96, was held in Aizu, Japan from March
18-21, 1996. A rousing success! Check out the Async96 home page for more
information. 

The 1997 confernce, Async97, will be held in Eindhoven, The
Netherlands, from April 7-10 1997. The Async97 home page
has more details. 
 Asynchronous Circuits Tutorial I gave a
tutorial on asynchronous circuits at the 2nd Working Conference on
Asynchronous Design Methodologies in London. If you're curious and
would like to see the slides, they are available as a postscript
file containing the slides, one per page, or in a more compact
format as a postscript file with  four
slides per page.
 Computer Folklore I gave a paper on computer
folklore entitled The Heroic Hacker: Legends of the Computer
Age at the American Folklore Society annual meeing in Pittsburgh,
PA (October 1996). Materials relating to this talk Can be found here
