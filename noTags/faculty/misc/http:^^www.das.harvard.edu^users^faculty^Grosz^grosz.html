Artificial Intelligence
Professor Grosz's research in artificial intelligence deals with
problems in natural-language processing and collaborative
planning. She is attempting to identify the basic structures and
processes by which people use languages to communicate information and
is developing mechanisms to enable computer systems to communicate
fluently with users in natural languages (e.g., English, Spanish,
Japanese). More generally, Professor Grosz hopes to improve
human-computer communication by utilizing techniques that combine
speech, graphics, and other modalities. Her current work encompasses:
computational theories of discourse and discourse processing,
computational models of collaborative planning, investigations of the
interactions between intonation and discourse, and the development of
collaborative, multimedia systems for human-computer
communication.
Professor Grosz has developed a theory of discourse structure that
specifies how discourse interpretation depends on interactions among
speaker intentions, attentional state, and linguistic form. This
theory has been used to explain such phenomena as interruptions, the
use of cue phrases, and the interpretation of referring
expressions. With colleagues at AT&T Bell Laboratories, she is
using the theory to study the information about discourse structure
conveyed by intonation, i.e., how tones demark, in spoken language,
some of the structure that paragraphs and parentheses indicate in
written language. Applications of this work should lead to better
computer speech-synthesis systems. In addition, Professor Grosz is
also involved in an interdisciplinary investigation of the connections
between centering of attention and form of reference.
Professor Grosz is also working on a theory of collaboration to
support the construction of intelligent computer "agents" that work
together in teams. This theory also provides a basis for modeling the
intentional component of discourse structure.
