 Todd Proebsting's Home Page 




Todd is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the
University of Arizona,
where he conducts research in compiler related areas.
Todd's longterm goal is to set up the "Uniprocessor Research Lab."

 During the Fall 1996 semester, Todd is teaching undergraduate compilers,
CS 453,
and a graduate seminar on Java Language Implementation,
CS 620.

 Todd plays first base for the 
Geek Gods.

 He holds a B.A. degree in Mathematics from
Carleton College,
and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from
University of Wisconsin-Madison.





  Research Projects 



 Todd leads the  Sumatra Project,
	which investigates high-performance mobile code.
	The projects first project is a "reference compiler" for Java, 
	 Toba ,
	which is a Java-bytecode-to-C translation system that yields very
	efficient (but non-mobile) Java executables.
	



  On-line Help 



 
	Windows 95 for Moms,
	Todd A. Proebsting,
	On-line answers to routine Windows 95 questions, which should be easy to find in the documentation, but aren't.

 Workshops 




Todd was Program Chairman for the Inaugural Workshop on Compiler Support for Systems Software (WCSSS'96).

	




 Software 




	Press on
	BURG
	to get a compressed shar file of the BURG code-generator generator
	system.
	BURG is based on tree-pattern matching and dynamic programming.
	
	Press on
	IBURG to
	go to the IBURG home page where you can get the IBURG code-generator
	generator system.
	IBURG is compatible with
	BURG.
	IBURG produces slower code generators, but does so very quickly.
