Prof. Irving Biederman


  Irving Biederman is the William M. Keck Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience
at the University of Southern California, where he is a member of the Departments
of Pyschology, Computer Science, and Neuroscience and Head of the Cognitive and
Behavioral Neuroscience Program. Professor Biederman has proposed a theory of real-
time human object recognition that posits that objects and scenes are represented
as an arrangement of simple volumetric primitives , termed geons. This theory has
undergone extensive assessment in psychophysical experiments. Recently, he has
employed a neural network model to provide a more biologically based version of the
 geon assemblage theory which is currently undergoing tests through single unit
recording experiment in monkeys, fMRI, and the study of the impairment of object
recognition in patients with a variety of neurological symptoms.
