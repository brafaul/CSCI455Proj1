Judy Goldsmith's Home Page


I am in the Department of
Computer Science at the University
of Kentucky.

My research interests are structural complexity and logical complexity
of computational complexity classes.  I have been learning about 
Markov decision processes, DNA computing, 
and logic programming. 

I am currently teaching 
CS 245, 
Discrete Math,  
and
CS 580, 
Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
Next semester, I will be teaching CS 675, Computability and Complexity.
The time and place for CS 675 have been changed, to 11 am MWF, in
145 P.O.T.
If you want to find me, here is my
 schedule. 
My email address is goldsmit@cs.engr.uky.edu and office phone number is
606-257-4245.

In addition to my academic interests, I dance with
Squash Beetle Morris, 
I bicycle, and I also try to find time for contra dancing, ballroom
dancing, and swing.
