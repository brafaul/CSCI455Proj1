Programming Languages and
Environments
Professor Cheatham conducts research concerned with understanding,
formalizing, and automating the software process and has the long-term
goal of dramatically increasing our ability to develop, maintain, and
enhance advanced software systems.
One of Professor Cheatham's current projects involves the
development of a new programming language and support environment. The
key feature of this language is its extensibility; it provides for
user-defined constructs that permit programming at a very high level
and for a range of mechanisms to help in transforming a very high
level program into efficient realizations on various target
computers. The accompanying programming environment will exploit
modern work-stations with large memories, high processing speeds, and
high resolution color graphics connected via high bandwidth
networks.
Professor Cheatham and his colleagues and students have also
recently begun work on methods and supporting tools for the
implementation of algorithms for massively parallel computers.  They
are developing a system called H-BSP that is based on the Bulk
Synchronous Parallel Model developed by Prof. L. Valiant BSP Page.
The goal of a third project is to model many of the
communication-intensive activities that take place in a large software
project, or any large cooperative enterprise, and to provide computer-based
support for the orderly execution of these activities.
