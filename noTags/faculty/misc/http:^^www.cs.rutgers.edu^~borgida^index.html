RESEARCH INTERESTS: 
	Improved development techniques for *Information* *Systems*.

IS maintain models of some aspect of reality that can be inspected and
modified through programs.  This topic overlaps with the area of
*databases* through its concern with managing large models, and with
*knowledge representation*, through its interest in inference and the
natural modeling of the users' world.

 I pursue my goal through research on *languages* for expressing the
requisite information (including their formal description and
implementation), and *methodologies and tools* for IS software
development.  The issues I have examined ranged throughout the
software life-cycle, including requirements, design, implementation,
and the cognate area of Knowledge Representation.
