RESEARCH

"Auditory Representation of Scientific Data", NSF Grant IRI-9214694 (1993-1994)

The long-term goal of this work is to develop and evaluate auditory
representations of multidimensional data.  The specific goals for
this project are


to build a prototype computing environment for research in
auditory data representation
to develop several different auditory data representations
to conduct preliminary testing and demonstrations of the auditory
data representations with both real and synthetic data


"Developing Image Processing Applications on the Terasys Workstation", Supercomputing Research Center, Institute for Defense Analyses, contract no. 06227 (1993)

We have developed a system that provides the capability to encode
multiparameter image data using various color models.  This system
allows the comparison and exploration of the potential merits of
different color models for multiparameter image processing.  The
current system is a sequential implementation.  The parallel version
we are implementing under this project would allow a user to
interactively select and change color models in real time.  We believe
that such a capability will greatly enhance the ability to detect
patterns in significant application data such as medical
imagery.
