 Interests
Numerical algorithms, their analysis, and related issues,
primarily in the areas of optimization and linear algebra.  I am especially 
interested in the analysis of eigenvalues, which arise in many different 
areas of applied mathematics.  For example, recent special interests include 
semidefinite programming and stability of Hamiltonian systems.
