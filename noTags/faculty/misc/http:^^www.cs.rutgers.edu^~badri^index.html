 Research
  Welcome to the world of  Badri's Research . 

  My research interest is primarily in the area of 
   Mobile Wireless Computing.
  I am part of the  
 Dataman   project whose goal is to design 
  information services for wireless and mobile users. The 
  primary research issues being investigated include: 

  Mobility  
     As hosts move, environment changes. How should the network
     handle moving hosts? How should the mobile host react to 
     change in environment?
      Wireless   The ``thin" pipe
    "fat" pipe problem.
    Wireless link has lower bandwidth ("thinner") than
    the fixed network. How should applications be structured to handle
    a pipe made of fixed and wireless links.  
      Energy     Battery is a consumable resource.
    How to extend battery life? Software approaches and
    hardware approaches to save energy.
    

Specific projects include:

  Environment awareness and client server adaptation 
      Composing client and server modules for easy 
      adaptation and migration. Functionality caching support.
      Event detection and handling mechanism
  Protocols for wireless/wireline networks  
      Considering wireless parameters such as cost,  
      packet-oriented vs connection-oriented, signal strength, 
      bandwidth, asymmetric links,
      multi-hop links, and long delay in designing end-to-end protocols 
  Disconnected operation for databases 
      Answering queries in disconnected mode. Hoarding data by issuing
      queries. Integrating data and concurrency control issues.
       Local caching issues.
  Designing ISPN with mobile hosts  
      Providing QoS for mobile hosts. 


As part of our research we have developed 
 multicasting protocol for mobile hosts, designed
distributed algorithms for systems with mobile hosts,
developed an indirect model for protocols  so that it works
better in wireless/wireline networks, developed data organization
and data dissemination methods for broadcast data, and 
currently investigating operating system support
for mobile hosts.
