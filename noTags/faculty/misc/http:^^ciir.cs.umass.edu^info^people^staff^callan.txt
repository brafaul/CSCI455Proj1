Jamie Callan is a Research Assistant Professor.  His research includes
improved methods of representing and retrieving full-text documents,
high speed document filtering algorithms, and algorithms that learn a
person's information needs.  He also works actively with members of
the 
Center for Intelligent Information
Retrieval
to define technology
transfer projects involving the
INQUERY
information retrieval and InRoute document filtering systems.
