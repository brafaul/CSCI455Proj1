Biography

Ellen W. Zegura received the B.S. degree in Computer Science (1987), 
the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (1987), the M.S. degree
in Computer Science (1990) and the D.Sc. in Computer Science (1993)
all from 
Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.
Her graduate research involved the analysis of switching networks
to support multipoint and multirate communication.  This work included
the development of analytic models to evaluate blocking probability
in multipoint switching topologies, as well as the development and
application of a methodology for comparing switch architectures using
a model of cost that is closely coupled to implementation technologies.




Her current interest is in wide-area networking support for complex
applications.  In particular, the projects focus on dealing with 
fluctuations in wide-area performance that occur on a time scale
that is slow enough to be tractable, yet fast enough to require dynamic,
on-line solutions.    The complexity in applications may come, for example, from
multi-stream interactions, widely varying quality of service requirements,
or dynamic multicast session membership.   The solutions involve both network 
architectures and algorithms, as well as end-to-end solutions.
More detail on particular projects may be found below.
