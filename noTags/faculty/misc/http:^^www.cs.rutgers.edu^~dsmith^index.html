IN PREPARATION


 Research Interest

  VLSI design and manufacture including simulation, evaluation,
manufacturability, fault detection, and diagnosis.

  AI-based design-systems applied to real-world problems.

  Massively parallel, fine-grain computer architectures including
hardware/software tools and interfaces. 

  Application of massively parallel computing to complex
real-world problems.



 Research Projects

  I am a researcher and area coordinator for microlithographic design
on the HPCD Project .

The Hypercomputing and Design Project (HPCD) is an ARPA sponsored
project developing advanced AI-based design methodologies covering a
wide range of applications.  The microlithographic area within this
project is investigating the application of design techniques to the
problem of mask and process design for sub-1/4 micro-chip fabrication.

  I am a co-PI of the 
Rutgers CAM Project.  

This is an ARPA sponsored project designing a cost-effective
general-purpose memory architecture based on concepts drawn from the
areas of associative processing and content addressable memory.

  I am also working in the areas of conceptual design of aircraft and
the design of supersonic and hypersonic inlets.  This work is
sponsored by NASA-AMES and by ARPA under 

the HPCD Project .
