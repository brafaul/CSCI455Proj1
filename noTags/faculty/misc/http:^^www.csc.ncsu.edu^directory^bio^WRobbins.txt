Woodrow E. Robbins




Professor
Ph. D., Syracuse University, 1971
Dr. Robbins is active in the department's computer graphics research group and
participates in the continued development of the Computer Graphics Laboratory
as a leading-edge facility.  His research interests include true 3D imaging,
algorithms, visualization, and the role of color in image representation.  On a
national and international scale, he has co-taught computer graphics courses at
SIGGRAPH and at International Society for Optical Engineering(SPIE)
conferences, has chaired conferences on 3D display technologies at SPIE and has
given presentations at Society for Information Display(SID) symposia.
