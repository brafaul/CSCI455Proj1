G&eacuterard Medioni received the Dipl&ocircme d'Ing&eacutenieur from the
Ecole Nationale Sup&eacuterieure des T&eacutel&eacutecommunications,
Paris, France in 1977 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from
USC
in 1980 and 1983, respectively. His primary research interests are in all aspects of computer vision:
low level tasks such as edge detection and contour extraction, grouping of such features into more
semantic entities, inference of shape from various sources, representation of visual knowledge,
algorithms and architectures to carry out the previous tasks.
