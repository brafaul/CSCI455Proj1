Research Interests


Research interests center around the development, understanding and
application of architectures capable of supporting general intelligence.  The
current focus is on Soar, a
multi-disciplinary, multi-site attempt at developing and applying such an
architecture.  Related to this overall focus are interests in machine
learning, problem solving and planning, production systems, autonomous agents
in simulation environments, expert systems, neural networks, and cognitive
modeling.
