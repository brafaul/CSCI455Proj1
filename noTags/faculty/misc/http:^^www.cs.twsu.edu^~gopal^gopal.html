Teaching

    This semester (Fall 1996), I am teaching the following three classes.

 CS211, Problem Solving and Program Design in C, Section 1255
 CS211, Problem Solving and Program Design in C, Section 1261
 CS540, Operating Systems, Section 1318


    Next semester (Spring 1997), I will be offering a new course
titled "Error Correcting Codes". You will soon be able to find information
about the course here. 

  

Research Interests

    The following areas represent my research interests.


 Cryptography:   correlation-immune and resilient functions, secret
sharing schemes, authentication codes, public-key cryptography,
digital signature schemes, zero knowledge protocols and identification schemes.  Combinatorics:   orthogonal arrays, perpendicular arrays, t-designs,
balanced incomplete block designs, algebraic combinatorics, extremal
combinatorics.
 Discrete Mathematics:   discrete mathematics pertinent to computer
science such as graph theory, matroid theory, coding theory etc.
 Algorithms:   design and analysis of sequential, parallel and 
randomized algorithms, combinatorial optimization, approximation
algorithms, derandomization techniques.
 Theoretical Computer Science:   complexity theory, computability,
unsolvability, logic, formal languages and automata theory.
 Applications:    computer security, VLSI design and testing and
information retrieval.
