   My research interests are in the area of graph algorithms. I am particularly
interested in recognition algorithms for classes of graphs with interesting 
representations. Examples of classes of graphs I work with include 
permutation graphs, comparability graphs, circular-arc graphs, circle graphs,
trapezoid graphs, and two dimensional partial orders. If you are interested in
this type of research, you might look at some web files which I will try to
get started here.
   I received a BS in Computer Science from Yale University and a PhD in
Computer Science from princeton University in 1978 and 1982 respectively.
You will find a list of my journal publications here.
