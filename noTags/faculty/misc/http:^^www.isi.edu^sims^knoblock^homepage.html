 Background 

I am a Senior Research Scientist at the USC Information Sciences Institute and a
Research Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at
the University of Southern California.  I have been at the University
of Southern California since 1991.  I received both my M.S. and
Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1988 and
1991, and I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Syracuse
University in 1984.  
 Research Interests 

My current research interests are on developing and applying planning,
machine learning and knowledge representation techniques to the
problem of providing access to distributed, heterogeneous information
sources.  For more information about the overall project, see the SIMS Project
home page.
