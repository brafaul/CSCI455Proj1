Michael Waterman holds an Endowed Associates Chair at USC.  He came to USC in
1982 after positions at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Idaho State University. 
His bachelors in Mathematics is from Oregon State University, and his PhD in
Statistics and Probability is from Michigan State University.  He was named a
Guggenheim Fellow (1995) and was elected to the American Academy of Art and
Sciences in 1995.  Also he is a Fellow of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science and Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

Professor Waterman works in the area of Computational
Biology, concentrating on the creation and application of mathematics,
statistics and computer science to molecular biology, particularly to DNA, RNA,
and protein sequence data.  He is the co-developer of the Smith-Waterman
algorithm for sequence comparison and of the Lander-Waterman formula for physical
mapping.  He is a founding editor of
Journal of Computational
Biology, and author of the text Introduction to Computational
Biology: Maps, sequences and genomes.
