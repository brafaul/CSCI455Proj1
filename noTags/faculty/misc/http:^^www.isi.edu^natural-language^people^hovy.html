Research Interests

Currently heading the Natural Language Processing group at USC/ISI doing 
research on various aspects of natural language processing, specifically 
on Machine Translation and automated text planning and generation.  Am 
personally involved in five research directions: the construction of the 
Pangloss family of machine translation systems (this work originally in 
conjunction with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and New Mexico 
State University); the development of theories of discourse structure and 
the construction of multisentence text and sentence planning systems (this 
work in collaboration with researchers at the Universities of Waterloo and 
Toronto in Canada); the development of sentence generation theory and 
systems, including management of the Penman project; the development of 
theory to address problems in multimedia human-computer communication (in 
collaboration with people at ISI); and the development of MEDTRANS, a system 
to translate and convey forms and information among Health Care providers 
(this work in collaboration with the DSSA group at ISI).  


My Ph.D. (Computer Science, Yale University, 1987) focused on the development 
of a text generation program that took into account the pragmatic aspects 
of communication, since the absence of sensitivity toward hearer and context 
has been a serious shortcoming of generator programs written to date. I am 
interested in all facets of communication, especially human language, as 
used to express intelligence. 

Member of the Executive Board of the Association for Computational 
Linguistics (ACL) for 1993-1995 and Vice President of the Association 
for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA).
