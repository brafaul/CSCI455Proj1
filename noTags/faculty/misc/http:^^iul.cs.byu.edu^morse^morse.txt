Computer Science.
He received his B.S. (1986) and M.S. (1990) degrees in 

Computer Science
from 

Brigham Young University.  
In between his undergraduate
and graduate work, he worked for IBM's Federal System Division in

His interest in images continued during his graduate studies and into
his current research.

The title of his doctoral dissertation was
Computation
of Object Cores from Grey-level Images, copies of which are
available electronically.


Research Interests
Computational vision, image understanding, and image processing.

Secondary interests in computer graphics, parallel systems,
and program creation.

A list of 
selected publications
is available electronically.
