Professor 

S. B. Mathematics (1971), Ph.D. Mathematics (1975) 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

Statement of Purpose:
find simplicity in unexpected places. 
Areas of Interest: 

 
 Visualization and animation of data
 
 Realtime systems and protocols


 Summary of Research
 
My research interests fall into two areas --- systems and visualization.
In the systems area I have been working protocols for dynamic terrain
updates in distributed interactive simulations and on visualization
of network protocols.   My visualization work centers on 
modeling and animation of experimental data.  Specifically my work
combines image processing, visualization, and modeling to analyze
video images of the dynamic modes of premixed flames.  Physicists 
at the University of Houston led by Michael Gorman perform the experiments
and  theoretical analysis in conjunction with the visualizations.
