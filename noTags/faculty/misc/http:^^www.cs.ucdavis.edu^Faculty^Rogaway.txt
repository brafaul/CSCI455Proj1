Phillip Rogaway - Field of Interest

UC Davis
Department of Computer Science





Phillip Rogaway
Assistant Professor

Professor Rogaway studies cryptography, protocols, network security, and theory of computation.  Recently he has focused on the design and analysis of cryptographic protocols which are simultaneously efficient and provably as secure as some underlying primitive.  Professor Rogaway has developed an approach called "practice-oriented provable security".  Recent results involve message authentication, digital signatures, entity authentication, and encryption.
