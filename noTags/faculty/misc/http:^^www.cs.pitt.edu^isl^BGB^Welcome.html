Welcome to Bruce Buchanan's Home Page



 Bruce G. Buchanan
(a.k.a. buchanan@cs.pitt.edu)

I am a Professor of Computer Science,
Philosophy, and Medicine, with the Department of Computer Science at
the University of Pittsburgh.
I am also co-Director of the Keck Center
for Advanced Training in Computational Biology.


My main
research interests are in machine learning, knowledge-based
systems, medical expert systems, and computational biology.


I am generally interested in
applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to any
problems
in biology or medicine.
For an extended discussion of how I view AI research, see

B. G. Buchanan, "Artificial Intelligence as an Experimental  Science."
In J. H. Fetzer (ed.) Aspects of Artificial Intelligence,
Amsterdam:  D. Reidl, 1988.
Recent Research

  AI approaches to machine learning -- development of the RL induction
syste
m
  Applications of symbolic learning to problems in biology and
medicine
  Case-based reasoning with application to prediction of protein 2ary
