Neal R. Wagner

Associate Professor 

Ph.D., M.A., Mathematics,

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1970. 
B.A., Mathematics and English,

University of Kansas, 1962. 


 Areas of Interest 
Cryptography, 
   database security, randomization, and visualization.
 Summary of Research

Current work also looks at the use of cryptography and randomization in
a distributed setting, particularly solving distributed security
problems using coin-flipping techniques.
I am also interested in visualization, with a current project to
visualize Internet news.
