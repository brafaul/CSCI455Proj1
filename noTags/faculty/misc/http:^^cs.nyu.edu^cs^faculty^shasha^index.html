Research   I do research in biological
computing, fault-tolerant parallel computing, information tailoring for
difficult documents like laws, real-time scheduling, and write some fun
books. See  Research Activity in brief or
a five page postscript blurb on my main activities and
plans. If you want a truly stimulating reading experience, try my
 resume in postscript.
For excerpts
of my latest book (short biographies of great computer scientists), see
 Out of Their Minds: the lives and discoveries of 15
great computer scientists
Here is a link to the
technical reports offered by the department. (You won't find much of my
stuff there, since I usually go straight for conference pubs.)
