 Research and Teaching Interests: 
 One great challenge that faces broadband networks is the ability
to provide guaranteed performance to diverse traffic types based on
their quality of service (QoS) requirements, while at the same time
efficiently utilizing the network capacity. Many issues are involved
in such performance-driven problems, including the type of guarantees 
required, traffic characteristics, congestion control mechanisms 
implemented at various nodes along the patch, bandwidth allocation
algorithms, and buffer management schemes. Altogether, these factors
determine the performance of the network.
 Therefore, the main goal of my research is to develop efficient
techniques and accurate models that can be used to provide QoS
guarantees for communicating sessions in ATM-based networks. Relevant
issues will be studied during the course of this research by using
actual performance data from our ATM testbed. Examples of general
research topics within the domain of QoS which are currently being
studied include:


characterization of multimedia traffic
bandwidth allocation algorithms
buffer management schemes
traffic policing mechanism
