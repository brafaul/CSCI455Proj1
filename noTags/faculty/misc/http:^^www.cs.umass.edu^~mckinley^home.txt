 Research Summary  

My main research focus is on developing compiler algorithms and tools
that enable programmers to use a high-level programming style and
modern languages, and yet still achieve high performance on scalar,
parallel, distributed, and heterogeneous architectures.  I am also
interested in  developing scalable parallel and distributed
applications. For more details, click here.
