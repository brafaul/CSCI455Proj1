Research 

   The primary objective of our research is to design, construct, and
   empirically evaluate computational mechanisms to support
   intelligent human-computer interaction in educational and
   scientific software.  In particular, we focus on developing
   advanced animated and natural language explanation systems
   that facilitate learning and scientific analysis.  We pursue this
   work in three areas: Knowledge-Based Learning Environments,
   Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, and Natural Language
   Generation.  Much of this research is conducted through the
   IntelliMedia
Initiative.

  Knowledge-Based Learning Environments
 Research Focus: Animated pedagogical agents,
                     design-centered learning environments, intelligent
                     interfaces, and task modeling.
 Projects: Design-A-Plant
The Internet Protocol Advisor 
 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology
 Research Focus: Interactive advisory systems for
                     homology searching, heterogenous genomics database
                     integration, and explanation generation for complex
                     analysis tasks.
Project: The Genome Collaborator
 Natural Language Generation
 Research Focus: Explanation systems, natural
                     language revision,
		     functional/systemic realization,  knowledge-based
                     document planning.
 Projects:  Knight Fare
Revisor  The Docu-Planner
