Academic/Professional Information 
Since September 1994, 
I am a tenure-track faculty member in the 
Department of
Computer Science at CSUSB (California State University San Bernardino).
I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from 
 Rutgers University, New
Jersey, in 1994/1995. My specialization was (and still is) in the area
of Artificial Intelligence, in particular Knowledge Based Systems, 
Knowledge Based Design, Knowledge Compilation, and Knowledge Anything Else ...

My additional and more recent research interests are geared towards
"Taming the Web". In particular, I am exploring the potential of AI
methods in  customizing knowledge navigation tools (e.g., browsers) to
suit the informational needs of each individual user. A prototype system
SKIPPER is currently under development.
