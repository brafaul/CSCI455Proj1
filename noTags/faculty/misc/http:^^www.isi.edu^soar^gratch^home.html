Areas of Research Interest
My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, 
operations research, and statistics.  My dissertation research focused on
adaptive problem solving; that is, flexible problem solving approaches
that improve their behavior through experience.  I developed a statistically
rigorous learning approach for improving problem solving performance and 
demonstrated its effectiveness on a prototype scheduling system being
developed for NASA.  This learning system improved scheduling performance
over problem distributions based on actual NASA mission requirements.

research interests.
