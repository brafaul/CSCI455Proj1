 PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE 
I graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a Ph.D. in Computer
Science in 1987.  Since that time I have been a faculty member at N. C. State.




 TEACHING 
I teach courses on ...


Multimedia
Technology (graduate level)

Multimedia
Technology  (undergraduate level)
 	Computer
Architecture and Organization (undergraduate level)
NSF and IBM have generously provided equipment for  my courses on Multimedia
Technology. 




 RESEARCH 
My students and I are working on architectures and network protocols for
real-time communication, and resource allocation for real-time applications in
general.  The results of our  work (software and papers) can be obtained from
the repository for the
Real-Time Communication
Project. This site also has some of our work on statistical modelling of
compressed video.

I have worked on parallel processing of signal processing algorithms.  Our
current focus is on methods for specifying, partitioning, and scheduling
algorithms. Our results (software and papers) are available from the repository
for the
Calypso Project.

At one time I worked on VLSI Design and CAD algorithms.

My research has been sponsored by AFOSR, IBM, ONR, NSF, MCNC, and N. C.
State. I gratefully acknowledge this support.  




 COLLABORATIONS 
It has been a great pleasure to work with the following talented
individuals: Gavin Cato (PhD, 1996), Hussein Salama (PhD, 1996), Sanjeev Rampal
(PhD, 1995), Sean Alexandre (MS, 1994), Caglan Aras (PhD, 1992), Somnath
Viswanath (MS, 1992), and April Pennisi (MS, 1991).
Students I currently work with are Mike Izquierdo, Errin Fulp, Herbert
Rivera-Sanchez, and Steven Wright. Colleagues I collaborate with are
Yannis Viniotis and Winser Alexander.


 AFFILIATIONS 
  My home departments are the 
 Department of Computer Science  and the
 Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering  at
 N. C. State University.

I actively participate in the development and operation of the
 Multimedia Lab at N. C. State.

 I'm a member of the program committee for the
Third International
Conference on Computer Science and Informatics, to be held in the Research
Triangle on March 2--5, 1997.

I'm also a member of the editorial board for
IEEE Parallel and
Distributed Technology.
