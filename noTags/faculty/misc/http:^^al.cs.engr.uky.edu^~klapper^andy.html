 My hobbies include  
  Morris Dancing and  
  Bird Watching.  Sometimes I do both at the same time, but usually the
  other dancers get upset when I run into them. 
 My overall research interest is in applying algebra and number theory to
  problems in cryptography and communications.  My current research projects
  involve  2-Adic Shift
  Registers,  Sequences
  for CDMA Systems, and  Multicovering Radii of
  Codes
 Available papers.

 I am currently teaching  CS 685  
     Error Correcting Codes.
