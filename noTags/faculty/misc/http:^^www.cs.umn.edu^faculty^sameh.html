Professional Background
Assistant, Associate, and Professor, Department of Computer Science University of Illinois, Urbana, 1968-1991, 1992-1993
Associate Director, Center for Supercomputing Research and Development, University of Illinois, Urbana, 1984-1991.
Director, Center for Supercomputing Research and Development, University of Illinois, Urbana, 1992-1993.
William Norris Professor, and Head, Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota, 1991-1992, 1993- present.

Research Interests
Numerical Linear Algebra with emphasis on parallel computing. Current interests include(i) the development of preconditioned iterative parallel algorithms for solving those linear systems that arise from the finite element discretization of the 3-D Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, and (ii) the design and implementation of Problem Solving Environments (PSE's) on parallel platforms.

Current Research Projects

"Hierarchically Parallel Algorithms for Portable and Scalable Performance"; PI; NSF.
"Parallel Scalable Libraries for Large-Scale Applications"; PI; ARPA/NIST.
"Direct Simulation of the Motion of Particles in Flowing Liquids"; co-PI; NSF.
