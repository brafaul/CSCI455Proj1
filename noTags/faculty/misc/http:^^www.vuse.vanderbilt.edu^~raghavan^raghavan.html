Vijay Raghavan
Associate Professor of Computer Science and Computer Engineering
    Box 1679, Station B
    Vanderbilt University
 Nashville, TN 37235, USA
   

   My research interests are primarily in Computational Learning Theory
and System-Level Fault Diagnosis, but I am liable to work on 
anything interesting. I obtained a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Delhi in
1980, and M.S. and Ph.D degrees in Computer Science from University of
Minnesota in 1983 and 1988 respectively.  You will find a list of my
journal publications here and a summary of my graduate
students here. 

Currently, I run the Computer Science Departmental seminars (the "Withit" 
Seminars). You will find the schedule for the current semester 
here.
