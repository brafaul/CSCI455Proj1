The goal is to find faster ways to do the computations, especially through the application of advanced numerical techniques, and parallel algorithms.     Current work centers on further development of NAMD-an object-oriented parallel molecular dynamics program, which is part of MDScope-a computational environment for structural biology.  This work is done in collaboration with L. V. Kale, Klaus Schulten, and other members of the Theoretical Biophysics Group.         In particular, this work involves a classical mechanics model of atomic interactions.  In order to effect massive reductions in the computation requirements, it is necessary to find ways to take much larger time steps and ways to compute electrostatic interactions more quickly.  In the future it is also hoped that a systematic way can be found to reduce the degrees of freedom.     Skeel's sources of research funding include NSF and NIH.    Contact Information  3161 Beckman Institute  University of Illinois  405 N.
