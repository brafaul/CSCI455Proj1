 I received the B.Tech degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute 
 of Technology, New Delhi in 1986 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer 
 Science from State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1989 and 1991 
 respectively. Since 1991, I have been an Assistant Professor in the 
 Department of 
 Computing and Information Sciences at Kansas State University.




 Research Interests 

I am interested in Design and Analysis of Distributed Protocols. 
Most recently, I have been working on a compositional technique for 
designing distributed protocols. The technique allows many complex 
protocols to be designed from protocols performing simpler activities
