Professor George F. Luger 


Professor George F. Luger obtained a Ph.D. from the University of 
Pennsylvania in 1973. His specialty is artificial intelligence, especially 
computational models of human problem solving. He received a 
Burlington Foundation Award in May 1993. His special interests are 
artificial intelligence, computational models of human problem 
solving and knowledge engineering. He is coauthor of a popular 
Artificial Intelligence textbook and recently completed a textbook on 
Cognitive Science.
