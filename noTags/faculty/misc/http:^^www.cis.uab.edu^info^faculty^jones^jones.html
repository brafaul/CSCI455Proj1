 Internet Information Filtering Research and Tool Development 
The exponential growth of information available of the Internet together
with the accompanying increase in the complexity of the Internet itself
requires the development of more effective tools for accessing this 
environment. The goal of this research is to make contributions to the
basic understanding of both the structure and dynamics of information
processing in the Internet and to develop both extensions to existing 
filtering tools, which improve their effectiveness, and new approaches to
the filtering process. Methodologies which will be used include neural
networks, natural language understanding, and genetic algorithms. A research
group called Studies in Information Filtering Technology for Electronic
Resources (SIFTER) 
has been formed to pursue these 
investigations. The primary application of this research is to healthcare
delivery systems.
