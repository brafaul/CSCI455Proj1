A large annotated 
Computer Vision Bibliography
with indexes for Author, Journal/Conference, Keyword, or Words in title.
I have also processed the

Rosenfeld online bibliographies to generate the
same cross-linked files. These have a number of "errors" since the automatic
processing does not cover all cases.


The

Computer vision group at  USC 
has a number of research projects.
The

Computer Science Department Home Page describes the department.


USC has a complete web site with information on the University
and all the usual pointers.
