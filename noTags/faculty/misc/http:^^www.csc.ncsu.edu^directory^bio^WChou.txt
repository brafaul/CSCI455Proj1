Dr. Chou's research interest centers on optimization and performance evaluation
of communications networks and computer and communications systems.  Chou's
efforts are focused on applying heuristic algorithms and approximation models
to real systems.  Among his current works are integrating voice and data in a
fast packet network, applying expert system to protocol parameter
specifications and modelling communications networks, traffic control and
estimation in high speed networks.
