Rule-based optimization, collaborations between query optimizers
  and query-plan evaluators
RESEARCH
Rule-Based Optimization

   I am developing a rule-based query optimization environment.
   Innovations include the application of rules to more kinds of 
   optimizer decisions than is usual and encapsulations of rules 
   into modules with support for flexible intermodule control.
Collaborations Between Query Optimizers and Query-Plan Evaluators

   Polymorphic data types and dynamic binding challenge the capabilities
   of conventional query optimizers.   In this research I am exploring
   ways for optimization decisions to migrate back and forth between
   compile-time and run-time.  I am supported by a  National Science 
   Foundation Research Initiation Award for 1992-1994 to explore this 
   area.
