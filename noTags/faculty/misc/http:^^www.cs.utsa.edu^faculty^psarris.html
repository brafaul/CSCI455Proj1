 Summary of Research

The major goal of our research is the development of fast restructuring 
compilers for the automatic parallelization of sequential programs. Our 
objectives are the development of accurate data dependence analysis tests 
in order to obtain exact data dependence information and to rule out 
parallelism-restricting false dependences and the design of parallelism 
detection and scheduling algorithms for the exploitation of the inherent 
parallelism in sequential programs and their efficient execution on parallel architectures.
