"On Universal Classes of Extremely Random Constant Time Hash Functions
and their Time-space Tradeoff",
Apr. 1995


Abstract: 
A family of functions F that map [0,n]->[0,n], is said to be h-wise independent
if any h points in [0,n] have an image, for randomly selected f in F, that is
uniformly distributed.  This paper gives both probabilistic and explicit
randomized constructions of (n**epsilon)-wise independent functions, for
epsilon<1, that can be evaluated in constant time for the standard random
access model of computation.  Simple extensions give comparable behavior for
larger domains.  As a consequence, many probabilistic algorithms can for the
first time be shown to achieve their expected asymptotic performance for a
feasible model of computation.

This paper also establishes a tight tradeoff in the number of random seeds that
must be precomputed for a random function that runs in time T and is h-wise
independent.

"Toward a Usable Theory of Chernoff Bounds for Heterogeneous and Partially
Dependent Random Variables",
Apr. 1995


Abstract:
Let X be a sum of real valued random variables and have a bounded mean E[X].
The generic Chernoff-Hoeffding estimate for large deviations of X is:
P{X-E[X]>=a}<=min_{y>=0}exp(-y(a+E[X]))E[exp(y X)], which applies with a>=0
to random variables with very small tails.  At issue is how to use this method
to attain sharp and useful estimates. We present a number of Chernoff-Hoeffding
bounds for sums of random variables that may have a variety of dependent
relationships and that may be heterogeneously distributed.

"Double Hashing is Computable and Randomizable with Universal Hash Functions",
Apr. 1995


Abstract:
Universal hash functions that exhibit (c log n)-wise independence are shown to
give a performance in double hashing and virtually any reasonable
generalization of double hashing that has an expected probe count of
1/(1-alpha) + epsilon for the insertion of the (alpha n)-th item into a table
of size n, for any fixed alpha < 1 and epsilon > 0.  This performance is within
epsilon of optimal.  These results are derived from a novel formulation that
overestimates the expected probe count by underestimating the presence of
partial items already inserted into the hash table, and from a sharp analysis
of the underlying stochastic structures formed by colliding items.

"Closed Hashing is Computable and Optimally Randomizable with Universal
 Hash Functions",
Apr. 1995


Abstract:
Universal hash functions that exhibit (c log n)-wise independence are shown to
give a performance in double hashing, uniform hashing and virtually anyreasonable generalization of double hashing that has an expected probe count of
1/(1-alpha)+O(1/n) for the insertion of the (alpha n)-th item into a table of
size n, for any fixed alpha < 1.  This performance is optimal.  These results
are derived from a novel formulation that overestimates the expected probe
count by underestimating the presence of local items already inserted into the
hash table, and from a very sharp analysis of the underlying stochasticstructures formed by colliding items.

Analogous bounds are attained for the expected r-th moment of the probe count,
for any fixed r, and linear probing is also shown to achieve a performance
with universal hash functions that is equivalent to the fully random case.
