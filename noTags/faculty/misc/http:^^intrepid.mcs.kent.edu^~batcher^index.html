Professor



Dr. Batcher received a B.S.E.E. degree from Iowa State University in 
1957 and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois in 
1962 and 1964, respectively.  He worked in the Computer 
Engineering Department of Goodyear Aerospace Corporation (later 
Loral Defense Systems Division, now Lockheed-Martin Tactical 
Defense Systems Division) for 28 years where he developed the 
architectures of two SIMD parallel processors: the STARAN (1972) 
and the MPP (1983).  In 1989 he joined the faculty at Kent State 
University.  He is the author of several technical papers and has 14 
patents.  He discovered two parallel 
sorting algorithms: the odd-even mergesort and the bitonic 
mergesort.  He also discovered a method of scrambling data in a 
random access memory to allow accesses along multiple dimensions; 
these memories were used in the STARAN and the MPP.  In 1990, Dr.
Batcher was awarded the Eckert-Mauchly Award from the ACM and 
the IEEE Computer Society "for the pioneering implementation 
of parallel computers and for contributions to interconnection 
network theory."  He is a Fellow in the ACM and a member of 
SIGARCH.
