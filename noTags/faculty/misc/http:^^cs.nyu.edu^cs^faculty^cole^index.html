Research Interests

My main interest is the design and analysis of algorithms.
Recent work has been concentrated in the following areas: the design
of efficient algorithms for the PRAM model of parallel computation,
string and pattern matching algorithms, amortization as an analysis
technique, and network and routing problems.

Research Support

My research is currently supported in part by the National
Science Foundation through NSF grant CCR9503309.
