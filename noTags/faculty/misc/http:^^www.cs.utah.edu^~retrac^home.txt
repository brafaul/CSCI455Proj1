John B. Carter
Assistant Professor
Computer Science Department
University of Utah


Professor Carter joined the Department of Computer Science in January 1993.
His research interests include operating systems, parallel and distributed
computing, and multiprocessor computer architecture.  Of particular
interest are scalable shared memory architecture designs, both hardware and
software.  Dr. Carter is co-leading two ARPA-sponsored research projects:
the Avalanche scalable multiprocessor
architecture design effort and the Fast
and Flexible Mach-Based Systems effort (aka Mach 4).  The development
of an efficient and highly portable distributed shared memory system, Quarks, is part of this effort.



While a graduate student at Rice University, he designed, implemented, and
evaluated Munin, a distributed shared memory system that allows
shared memory parallel programs to be executed efficiently on distributed
memory multiprocessors.  He has also worked on  high speed bulk data
communication protocols.


For the Fall Quarter of 1995, I will be teaching the  Introduction to Operating Systems
course, CS506.  Meeting times are Tuesday-Thursday from 1:10pm-2:35pm
in EMCB 102.


Current Research Projects



Avalanche Scalable Multiprocessor Design:

The goal of this project to develop an integrated cache, memory, and
communication architecture that significantly reduces the latency of both
distributed shared memory and message passage multiprocessor communication.
The core processor of Avalanche will be the forthcoming PA-RISC 8000 CPU.
We are designing a new Context Sensitive Cache Controller Unit
that will support a flexible suite of cache coherence protocols for DSM
applications and provide context sensitive injection of incoming data into
the appropriate level of the memory hierarchy in order to minimize message
latency.

Primary research collaborators:
Al Davis,
Ravindra Kuramkote, and
Chen-Chi Kuo.
Other research collaborators:
Mark Swanson,
Leigh Stoller,
Benny Yih, and
Ashley Saulsbury.




Fast and Flexible Mach-Based Systems:
The goal of this project is to develop an operating system that provides a
much higher degree of flexibility than traditional operating systems, and
to use that added flexibility to circumvent the performance/functionality
tradeoffs that thwart traditional highly-decomposed, microkernel-based
operating systems.  Important components of this work are a module
management service, lightweight and decomposed Mach kernel functionality,
aggressive exploitation of interprocess sharing, and efficient distributed
shared memory (see below).  We will maintain backward compatibility where
practical, and freely distribute an unencumbered version of the entire
system.
Primary research collaborators:
Jay Lepreau,
Mike Hibler,
Jeff Law, and
Bryan Ford.




Quarks Distributed Shared Memory System:
The goal of this project is to develop an efficient, portable, and freely
available distributed shared memory system to support the shared memory
programming style on distributed memory multiprocessors and networks of
workstations.
Ideally, Quarks will eventually do for distributed shared memory what PVM
did for message passing -- make it relatively easy to use, pervasive
(ported to a wide array of systems), and reasonably efficient.
For more on our motivation, take a look at my
HOTOS '95 position paper.
An 
Alpha release of Quarks is currently available that runs on SunOS
4.1/SPARC machines, but ports are in progress to 68K BSD boxes,
HP-UX/PA-RISC, IRIX 5.2/MIPS, and the Mach operating system.
Primary research collaborators:
Dilip Khandekar and
Linus Kamb.


Here is a copy of the slides for my OSDI '94 
tutorial on distributed shared memory minus some of the graphs,
which I will incorporate soon.




Significant Past Research Projects

Munin Distributed Shared Memory System:

Munin was the first software distributed shared memory system to explore
the potential performance benefits of using a relaxed consistency model.
Among Munin's novel features were a software implementation of the release
consistency model, the first multiple writer memory consistency
protocol to address the problem of false sharing, support for
multiple consistency protocols (including user-supplied protocols), and an
update timeout mechanism to reduce the communication overhead of write
update protocols.  For shared memory programs with moderate to high degrees
of sharing, Munin achieved far greater performance (speedup) than
conventional distributed shared memory systems, usually within 10% of hand
coded message passing performance.  Many of the features and ideas first
developed in Munin have appeared in subsequent DSM systems.  Primary
research collaborators: Willy Zwaenepoel
and John Bennett.
Here is a copy of my dissertation concerning Munin.


Optimistic Bulk Data Transfer Protocol:

The key insight exploited in this effort was that when the first packet in
a `blast' of bulk data is received by a node, it is highly likely that no
packet outside the `blast' will arrive before the last bulk data packet is
received.  As such, upon receipt of the first packet in a blast of bulk
data, the network device layer should set things up to optimize this case.
This optimization, which was independently observed by Van Jacobson and
incorporated into TCP/IP, resulted in 9.2 Mbps bulk data transfer rates
between two SUN-3/50's on a 10 Mbps Ethernet.  At the time, the best TCP/IP
implementations achieved under 5 Mbps bulk data transfer rates.

Primary research collaborators:
Willy Zwaenepoel.
