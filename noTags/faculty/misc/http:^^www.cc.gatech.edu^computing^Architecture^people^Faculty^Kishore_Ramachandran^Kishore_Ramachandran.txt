Personal trivia...

I am married to Vasanthi, and we have two children Hemant (9 years of age
on 9/18/95)
and Shalini (7 years of age on 1/23/96).
I am an avid squash player, and can be arm-twisted to hold a tennis
racket every once in a while!  


Professionally Speaking...

I received my Ph. D.
in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1986
under the direction of
Marvin Solomon.
Since then I have been with Georgia Tech (home of the yellow jackets),
where I am currently an Associate Professor in the College of Computing.
My research interests are in the area of
architectural design, programming, and
analysis of parallel and distributed systems.
I was a Co-Principal investigator for the Clouds distributed operating system
project at Georgia Tech.  Currently I am investigating software
and hardware mechanisms for building scalable shared memory systems, and
studying the scalability of parallel systems from an applications perspective.
I received a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Award from the
National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1990, and the Georgia Tech doctoral
thesis advisor award in 1993.
