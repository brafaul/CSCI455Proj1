Research Interests
Dr. Dickinson's research focuses on computational vision. He is 
primarily interested in the problems of object modeling, object recognition
(both bottom-up and top-down), 
attention, shape recovery, and tracking, and how they may be 
unified under a single representational framework. In addition, 
his research explores the use of viewer-centered representations 
in landmark recognition and planning for mobile robot navigation.
In the domain of visual information management, his research
addresses the problem of content-based image retrieval.
