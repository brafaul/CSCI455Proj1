Mobile Computing Laboratory



I work in the fields of ``mobile computing'' and ``operating systems.''

The general challenge is how best to build systems of small, wireless,
mobile computers.  Current efforts focus on building ``reconfigurable
distributed services.''  The reconfigurable distributed services that
we have built so far are re-implementations of standard services
(e.g., file service, X11 window service, IP) employing new algorithms
internally that facilitate the following:
 operation in spite of disconnection and/or intermittent connection

 efficient use of limited bandwidth (wireless links current operate
only at kilobit-to-megabit speeds)

 dynamic service location

 dynamic load balancing (to improve latency and throughput)


I will continue to work on mobile computing during the next few years,
focusing on these new projects:
 making applications aware of, and able to react to, changes in their
location

 techniques for automatically and dynamically re-partitioning the
function of a program into a client portion (running on a mobile
computer) and a server portion (running on a stationary
``infrastructure'' machine)

 exploitation of low power, solid state non-volatile storage
technologies, such as flash EEPROM -- these devices are especially
well suited to portable computers

 a new architecture for distributed systems supporting mobility in
which an intermediary is interposed between client and server; the
purpose of the intermediary is to intelligently filter all but the
most essential data traveling from the infrastructure out to the
mobile host
