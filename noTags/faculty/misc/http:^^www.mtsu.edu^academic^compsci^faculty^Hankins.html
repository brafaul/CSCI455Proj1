GRANTS:


     Faculty Research Grant received Spring, 1994.  Received 
     funds for release time and student help to study "The Impact
     of Pedagogical Changes on Computer Science."  A paper has
     been submitted to SIGCSE as a result of the grant.

     Non-instructional assignment received for Spring, 1991.The
     study involved the production of a model for a graphical
     user-interface to aid the test engineer of large complex
     software systems.  The fields of system software testing and
     graphical user-interfaces were explored to seek a solution
     to this problem.   

     Public Service Grant received in 1989 to develop a
     seven-county directory of services for the homeless. 
     Co-recipient of the grant was Mrs. Brenda Parker.  The
     grant covered the cost of DBASE III, printing costs for
     directory and student help for data entry.  The
     directory was developed and was used by the Mid-
     Cumberland Community Action Agency.
