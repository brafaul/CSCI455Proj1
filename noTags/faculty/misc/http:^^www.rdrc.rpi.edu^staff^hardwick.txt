Bio

Dr Martin Hardwick is a Professor of Computer Science at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, and Director of the Laboratory for Industial
Information Infrastructure. He is a principal investigator in the DARPA
Initiative in Concurrent Engineering at Rensselaer, and has performed
research  for ARPA, NSF, GE, IBM, DEC, HP,  and Wright Patterson AFB. He
developed the ROSE data management tools for engineering, and has also
developed change management and version control tools for concurrent
engineering, visualization tools for STEP geometry, and data access
interfaces for STEP databases.

Dr. Hardwick is the author of numerous  papers on engineering database
systems, PDES/STEP and concurrent engineering, and has presented many
public lectures internationally on these topics. He is the deputy convenor
of Working Group 7 of ISO STEP, the group responsible for the STEP Data
Access Interface (SDAI) and other implementation methods of the STEP
standard.

Dr. Hardwick has worked on numerous data integration programs, including
the DARPA Initiative in Concurrent Engineering, the ARPA Simulation Based
Design Program, the NIST ATP PreAmp progrm, three NSF programs, and two Air
Force programs. Software written by Dr. Hardwick is being used for
PDES/STEP data exchange at several fortune 500 companies including in the
aerospace sector Boeing, McDonnel Douglas, GE and Pratt & Whitney, and in
the automotive sector GM, Ford and Daimler Benz. A team lead by Dr.Hardwick
was responsible for designing the protocols that allow different STEP
application protocols to inter-operate in a database. 

Dr. Hardwick is the president of STEP Tools Inc. a company that makes and
markets a set of software tools for the PDES/STEP standard. He received his
bachelor and doctorate degrees from Bristol University in England in 1978
and 1982. He is a member of the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM.
