SOFTWARE

 MARCA:  MARkov Chain Analyzer 

 Software for generating and analyzing large Markov chains models.
MARCA determines mathematical properties
of the chain, computes stationary and transient probability
distributions and mean time to absorption from arbitrary
starting states.
  MARCA_Models: 

 A Database of Markov Chain Models.
