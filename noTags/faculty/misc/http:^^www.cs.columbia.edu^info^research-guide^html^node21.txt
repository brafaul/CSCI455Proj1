My research is concerned with structural analysis of mathematical objects
and improving methods for representation of mathematical objects.  These
self-sufficient goals sometimes lead to improved algorithmic performance.
My particular interest is interconnection networks and their layouts.  My
methods are from the geometric side of algebraic topology and from the
algebra of permutation groups.  Here are several aspects of my recent
research.
