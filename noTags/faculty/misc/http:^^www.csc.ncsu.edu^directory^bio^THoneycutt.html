NCSU/CSC: Thomas L. Honeycutt





























Thomas L. Honeycutt




Associate Professor
Ph. D., North Carolina State University, 1969
Dr. Honeycutt's research interests lie in the areas of management information
systems (MIS), computer simulation, and expert systems in management.
Modelling the decision making process is the basic focal point of his research.
Decision support systems (DSS) evolved in the 1960's to support management
decision making.  Today, the expert system methodology is replacing the DSS
concept in industry.  Dr. Honeycutt's research extends the concepts of MIS, DSS
and expert systems to improve the basic decision making process through
reengineering and quality management.
