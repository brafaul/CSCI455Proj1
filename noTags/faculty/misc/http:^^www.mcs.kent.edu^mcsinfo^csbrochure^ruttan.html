Arden Ruttan
Associate Professor



Arden Ruttan received his Ph.  D.  in numerical analysis from Kent State
University in August 1977.  He was a postdoctoral fellow at California
Institute of technology from 1977-1978 and an assistant professor at
Texas Tech University from 1978-1983 before joining Kent State
University in 1983.  Currently, he is an associate professor of computer
science.  He is an associate member of the Institute for Computational
Mathematics and a faculty associate of the NSF Center for Advanced
Liquid Crystalline Optical Materials (ALCOM).  His funding includes
grants from Cray Research and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. 
 His research interests are scientific computing,
 highly ill-conditioned mathematical computations, problem of apriori
 algorithm selection, apostiori error analysis for numerical routines,
 parallel implementations of above problems.
