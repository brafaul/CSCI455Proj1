Dr.  LeBlanc's research interests include software engineering,
programming language design and implementation, and programming
environments.  Most of his research work, particularly that associated
with the Clouds Project, has involved application of these interests
in distributed computing systems.  He is also interested in
specification-based software development methodologies and tools.
Prof. LeBlanc has served as a technical consultant to industry on the
Ada language and Ada compilation techniques.  He has done consulting
work with the Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company on the development
of a specification-based methodology for producing highly reliable
digital flight control software and has served as a consultant on
software reliability and fault tolerance to corporations in the
computing and telecommunications industries.
