 Research Summary 

I am interested in how one uses computers to efficiently solve
algebraic and number-theoretic problems (example: how does one
tell if a 100-digit number is prime without examining all possible
factors?). These problems have intrinsic mathematical interest,
as well as applications to random number generation, codes for
reliable and secure information transmission, computer algebra,
and other areas. 

I am also interested in applying probability theory to the design
and analysis of algorithms. For example, if a large number is
composite, it can be proved so by a simple test that uses an auxiliary
number, called a `witness.' In practice one usually finds a witness
by direct search among the small primes. This leads to the following
natural question. How large is the least witness, as a function
of the number tested? In recent work, we have given an accurate
heuristic model, based on probabilistic assumptions, that allows
this, and similar questions, to be answered.
