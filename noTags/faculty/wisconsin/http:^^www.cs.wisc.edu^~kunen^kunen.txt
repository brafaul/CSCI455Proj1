Interests: automated deduction, logic programing,
set theory, topology


 Research Summary  
Most of my research work involves logic and its applications.


Typical applications are automated deduction and logic programming.
In automated deduction, we use tools like resolution
to prove new mathematical theorems.
In logic programming, we study the semantics of languages like
Prolog.  Specific topics I am considering are the Prolog
use of negation-as-failure, and the semantic incompatibilities between
least-fixed-point computations and the Prolog-style backtracking computation.


In mathematical logic, I work on axiomatic set theory.
Besides being of interest in its own right, this
subject relates to various abstract areas of mathematics,
such as set-theoretic topology and measure theory,
where many basic questions turn out to be independent of the usual
axioms of set theory.
