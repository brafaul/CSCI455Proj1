 Research Summary 


My current research focuses on the design of the
highest performance uniprocessors of a current generation.
Currently we are investigating the architecture of
a circa 2000 processor.  With plenty of transistors available
on a chip, the challenge is to use these resources to get
the highest possible performance when executing a sequential program.
A target that we have set for ourselves is to sustain the execution of
over 10 instructions per cycle,
for ordinary non-numeric application programs.

My research group is investigating several issues that need
to be resolved before our goals can be achieved.
We are studying and characterizing the
nature of instruction-level parallelism in non-numeric
application programs in order to understand the available parallelism and
how it could be exploited.
The bulk of my group's research effort is expended in continuing the
development of the
 Multiscalar  processing model,
a novel paradigm for exploiting ILP.
Currently we are developing the Multiscalar compiler, and
carrying out detailed simulation studies to assess
the potential of the Multiscalar concept.
