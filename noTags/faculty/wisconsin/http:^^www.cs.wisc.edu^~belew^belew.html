I am an associate professor of Computer Science, with special research
interests in machine learning and free-text information retrieval.
Virtually all of this work has been done with students, as part of a
research group we call the Cognitive Computer
Science Research Group.  I've tried to give an overview of the
research we've done in the sections below.  If you are looking for a
particular paper, you can proceed directly to the References
section, where a number of them can be found online.
