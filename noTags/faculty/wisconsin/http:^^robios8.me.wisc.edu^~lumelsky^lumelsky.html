 Research 
 My current research is in the area of fully automatic (robotic)
and human-centered semi-automatic systems, and covers theoretical,
simulation/animation, and experimental work.  In the area of fully
automatic systems, our focus is on development of means for
geometric reasoning and control necessary for automatic planning of
motion in a complex environment. A machine equipped with such means
is able to purposely move in a complex scene with multiple, perhaps
moving, obstacles of arbitrary shapes. We are especially interested
in a paradigm which assumes incomplete information and continuous
real-time computation based on sensory feedback (e.g., from vision
or range sensors). This model suggests economic  active sensing
 guided by the motion planning needs. A strong factor in such
systems is the effect of system dynamics and nonholonomic
contstraints on real-time control.
  
 As part of our work on human-centered systems, we study (jointly
with cognitive scientists) human skills in motion planning and space
orientation. These results are then used for comparison with the
performance of automatic systems and for developong hybrid physical
(teleoperated) and computer graphics interaction systems. The major
property of such a hybrid system is that it blends together, in a
synergistic manner, human and machine intelligences. Our
hardware/experimental work includes systems with massive real-time
sensing and control (e.g. with thousands of sensors operating in
parallel).
