Research Summary

My research focuses on I/O and storage management in uniprocessor and
parallel systems.  In particular, I am investigating two techniques to improve
file system performance: application-specific replacement policies for the file
cache, and aggressive prefetching of file data from the disk.  I have
developed a system in which the kernel allocates physical pages to individual
applications, and each application is responsible for deciding how to use
its physical pages for caching and prefetching.  The system uses a fair
global allocation policy in the kernel, and carefully integrates cache
replacement, prefetching and disk scheduling.  A prototype implementation
on uniprocessor systems has demonstrated
that good application-chosen replacement strategies and prefetching information
can significantly improve the I/O performance of many applications.

Currently, I am extending these techniques to parallel systems.  I am
developing integrated caching and prefetching algorithms for parallel disk
arrays.  In addition, I am investigating the global resource management
problems in operating systems.
