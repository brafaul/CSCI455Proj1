Research Summary

My research focuses on problems in programming computers.  As part of the
Wisconsin Wind Tunnel (WWT ) Project, I have
helped develop a hybrid (software-hardware), shared-memory computer
architecture that facilitates programming and compiling for parallel
machines.  Currently, my students and I are developing languages, compilers,
and tools to demonstrate and exploit the power of user-level coherence
policies.

I'm also interested performance evaluation tools that help programmers
understand and improve their programs' performance.  Recently, Tom Ball and
I developed an efficient path profiling algorithm, which provides a more
detailed understanding of control-flow within routines and which has
identified new possibilities for better compilers.
