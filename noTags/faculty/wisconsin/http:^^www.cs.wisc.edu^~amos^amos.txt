If you are here in order to download the paper

Affine systems: the analysis of the analysis operator

of Zuowei Shen and me, choose between the following versions:
if you are using Unix, click
HERE, to get a compressed version. 
Otherwise, download the uncompressed version from
HERE.
If none works, our ftp server may be down. Try then to get a copy directly

List of various publications, including  abstracts.




Selected 
 articles
of mine.



Information about anonymous ftp site.
Carl de Boor and I maintain an ftp site at
 ftp.cs.wisc.edu. 
The site contains
postscript and compressed postscript files of various articles of the
approximation theory group at UW. Also found there are technical files
concerning TeX, vi and more, that should be useful to the general public.
I recommend that you click the 

read.me file, which provides a list of available files, 
click there those that you wish to view (on-line),
view them on-line,  and download those you wish to.



My  Ph.D. students,
including information about their research and
publications.



My main areas of interest, together with a short 
summary of my present research and future goals in each one of these.



The activity of the Approximation Theory group at the Univeristy of
Wisconsin, Madison.



The activity of the 

Numerical Analysis group here.
