Research Summary
My research targets the memory systems of shared-memory multiprocessors
and high-performance uniprocessors.  Memory system design is important,
because it largely determines a computer's sustained performance.  My
work emphasizes quantitative analysis (often requiring new evaluation
techniques) of system-level (not just hardware) performance.


Much of my recent work is part of the Wisconsin Wind
Tunnel Projectwith Profs. Larus and Wood and many
students.  The project expects most future massively-parallel computers
will be built from workstation-like nodes and programmed in high-level
parallel languages--like HPF--that support a shared address space in
which processes uniformly reference data.  Our research seeks to
develop a consensus about the middle-level interface--below languages
and compilers and above system software and hardware.  We have recently
proposed the  Tempest interface that enables programmers,
compilers, and program libraries to implement and use message passing,
transparent shared memory, and hybrid combinations of the two.  We are
developing Tempest implementations on a Thinking Machines CM-5, a
cluster of workstations (COW), and hypothetical hardware platforms.
The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel project is so named because we use our tools
to cull the design space of parallel supercomputers in a manner similar
to how aeronautical engineers use conventional wind tunnels to design
airplanes.


Other recent work with Madhu Talluri
targets improving translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
and page table performance by clustering aligned groups of base pages.
Options require changes to hardware only (complete-subblocked TLBs),
operating system only (clustered page tables), or both (superpages
and partial-subblocked TLBs).

ASPLOS
and
SOSP
