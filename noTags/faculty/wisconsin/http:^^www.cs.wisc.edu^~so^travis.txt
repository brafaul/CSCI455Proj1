computer support for understanding complex data, philosophical foundations of
artificial intelligence, computing management, social implications of computing.


 Research Summary  
My research centers around using logic as a basis for knowledge 
formalization in expert systems and for deductive augmentation of database
systems.  Recent work has focused on non-procedural control of automatic
deduction and on design of systems that support the contruction, display,
and testing of high-level abstractions from patterns formed by information
contained in large, heterogeneous databases.  Special attention is being
devoted to the representation and use of geographic information in ways
that enhance data integration and data visualizability (as with maps).  I 
am actively involved with several expert system development projects and
with a large "intelligent" database project that incorporates databases,
"what if" modeling, and visualization aids into a single integrated system;
with organizational and social issues associated with the introduction and 
use of information technology; and with analysis of the pre-suppositions
underlying alternative approaches to artificial intelligence.
