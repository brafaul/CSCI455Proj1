 Research Summary 

We are primarily developing machine learning systems that combine the
strengths of symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence with those of
connectionist AI.  A major focus is improving the dialog between human
teachers and machine learners.  Traditionally, this interaction is limited to
the teacher providing labelled training examples to the machine.  Toward the
goal of widening the ``communication pipeline'' between human and machine, we
have been developing a language for providing, in a natural manner and at any
time, general-purpose advice to a machine learner.  In our approach, the human
advice-giver observes the behavior of the learner and occasionally makes
suggestions, expressed in a simple language.  Based on techniques developed in
our work on knowledge-based neural networks, these instructions are inserted
directly into learner.  Subsequent connectionist (neural network) learning
further integrates and refines the advice.


Currently, we are extending the language used to advise our learning algorithms, 
studying new ways of incorporating this advice into neural networks,
investigating the extraction of human-comprehensible rules from trained neural networks,
and developing methods for choosing good representations for training examples.  
We are also developing parallel algorithms, 
on the department's Condor system and our CM-5 computer,
for machine learning and computational biology.


Shavlik (1992) 
and (1996)
provide an overview of our approach to knowledge-based neural networks.
Recent developments appear in the papers referenced on this page, as well
