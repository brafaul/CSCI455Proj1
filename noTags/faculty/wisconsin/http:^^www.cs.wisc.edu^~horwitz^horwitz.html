Research interests:

language-based programming environments
program slicing, differencing, and merging
static analysis of programs
interprocedural dataflow analysis



Research Summary

My work mainly involves the design and implementation
of language-based programming tools that help programmers with problems like:

 understanding how existing programs work, and how they would be affected
by proposed modifications;
 understanding the textual, structural, and semantic differences between
two versions of a program;
 retesting a program after changing it;
 combining pieces of old programs to produce a new program, with certain
semantic guarantees.

This work has involved the use of a program representation called the
program dependence graph (PDG), and an operation called slicing.

I am also working on new algorithms for precise, interprocedural
dataflow analysis.
Previous work on interprocedural dataflow analysis mainly concentrated
either on efficient algorithms for specific individual problems,
or on (not necessarily efficient) algorithms for a general class of problems.
Thomas Reps, Mooly Sagiv, and I have developed and implemented a new
algorithm that is both efficient, and applies to a large class of problems.
