Professor Duffie's research in manufacturing systems involves integrating 
sensors, actuators, computers and data bases into advanced automated 
production systems. He has developed controls for self-guided inspection 
machines and welding robots, high-performance material handling systems, 
and automated finishing systems for mold and die production and rework. He 
is studying highly distributed, non-hierarchical system control architectures 
in hope of reducing cost and complexity in large-scale, computer-controlled 
manufacturing systems while increasing flexibility and fault tolerance. 

Duffie has constructed several experimental manufacturing systems 
that incorporate real-time, fully distributed scheduling and optimization 
into their control systems. He is developing theories explaining the properties 
and performance of these systems.

Duffie is associate director of the 
Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics. Research at the NASA-funded 
center emphasizes automated agriculture systems, sensors for tactile feedback
 to human operators in telerobotic systems, and methods for performance 
evaluation, as well as human factors research in sensory feedback and fatigue. 
He has developed a telerobotics test bed in which experimental work is 
carried out.

Duffie works closely with manufacturing and aerospace industries and teaches 
courses on manufacturing systems, automatic controls and computer controls. 
He co-authored Computer Control of Machines and Processes.
