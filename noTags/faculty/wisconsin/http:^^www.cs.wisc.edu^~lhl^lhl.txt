 Research Summary 

My research program focuses on high speed networks. We are participating
in the Gigabit project, a DARPA-NSF national project which involves
the design and implementation of network testbeds operating at
gigabit per second data rates. At Wisconsin we are working on
issues of protocol design, congestion and admission control, visualization
of atmospheric phenomena and virtual conferencing.
