 Research Summary 

I am interested in analytic modeling techniques and their application
to computer system performance issues, with an emphasis on parallel
and distributed system design issues. The modeling techniques
I have developed together with graduate students and colleagues
include the Generalized Timed Petri Net, and customized
mean value analysis. The GTPN can represent parallel system
features such as synchronization and priority service precisely.
The customized MVA technique yields a set of intuitive equations
that represent parallel system features more approximately but
can be solved more efficiently. We have also recently proposed
the use of a technique called interpolation approximations
for analysis of parallel processor allocation policies. This technique
may also have broader applicability for parallel systems performance
analysis. 

Current research projects include characterization for high-performance
parallel workloads, analysis of parallel processor scheduling
policies, scheduling issues in multimedia servers, and memory
management policies for networks of workstations.
