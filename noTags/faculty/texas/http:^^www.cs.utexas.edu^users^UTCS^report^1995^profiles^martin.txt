Mathematical logic and computer architecture 
Summary of Research

My current activity concentrates on abstract structures as
interpretations of logical theory, centering on closure spaces, which
exploits the notion of deductive closure; on logical operations; and
on intensional models of classical mathematics. My most significant
earlier research was on computer architecture and logical design,
especially for missile and space vehicle applications, tracking
algorithms for track-while-scan radars, functional completeness in
many-valued and delay logic and logical metatheory.
