Areas of Interest

Mathematical software and numerical analysis 
Summary of Research

I am interested in the transformation of mathematics into tools which
can be applied to scientific problems. This involves the construction
of mathematical software and the exploration of methodologies for
mathematical software. In particular, my major software development
has been a package of over one hundred subprograms for curve and
surface fitting employing tension splines.
