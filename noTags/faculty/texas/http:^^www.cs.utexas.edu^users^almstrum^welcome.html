About Me

I am an educator and a computer scientist.  I am very interested in 
understanding how people learn what they learn.  I am particularly interested
in the learning of mathematical logic and formal methods.  My doctoral
research was on the topic of Limitations in the Understanding of Mathematical
Logic by Novice Computer Science Students.

I am a lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin.  In addition, I
spent the fall semester of 1995 teaching in Uppsala Sweden.  My 
home page
there is a link into that university.

Other interests include encouraging others to excel in mathematics and computer
science, gardening, travel, crafts such as sewing and woodworking, etc.  
Here's a picture of me with my hubby, Torgny Stadler.
