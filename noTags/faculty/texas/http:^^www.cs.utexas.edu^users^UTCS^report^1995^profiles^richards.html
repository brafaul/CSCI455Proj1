Summary of Research 
I maintain a long-standing interest in functional programming, its potential
for concurrent processing, and its suitability for formal reasoning. In
Fall 1995 I am using a functional programming language in teaching a section
of CS1, and I am working as time permits on a functional-language implementation
of a real microcomputer application. A longer-term project is a book on
functional algorithms.
