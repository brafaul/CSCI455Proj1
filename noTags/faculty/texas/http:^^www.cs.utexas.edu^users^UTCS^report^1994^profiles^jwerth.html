Areas of Interest

Parallel programming, software engineering, compilers, and computer
science education 
Summary of Research

My current interest is in programming environments for parallel
programming and the associated software engineering, compilation, and
implementation issues. I am also active in setting directions in
computer science education on both local and national levels.
