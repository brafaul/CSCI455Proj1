Interconnection networks and parallel processing in computer architecture 
Summary of Research

My research in computer architecture focuses on interconnection
networks.  The success or failure of parallel computing systems rests
in the ability to devise appropriate cost/performance interconnection
structures. The most recent work on interconnections involves the
development of a wafer scale optical interconnection. A special kind
of laser and wave guide has been designed and is being
investigated. This technique leads to very fault-tolerant parallel
systems on the wafer. This same optical interconnection is being
applied to optical systems busses and optical communication
switches. Work on the performance of processor systems is
continuing. A methodology for measuring processor performance
portability across machines has been developed. In contrast to
benchmarking, it represents true measurement of a processor/memory
system.
