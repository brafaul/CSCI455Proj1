Carl Ebeling, Associate Professor, has a B.S. in Physics, Wheaton
College, 1971; an M.S. in Computer Science, Southern Illinois
University, 1976; and a Ph.D. in Computer Science, Carnegie-Mellon
University in 1986. He joined the UW in 1986.
 
Carl Ebeling's research interests fall into two categories: VLSI
architectures and computer-aided design of digital systems. He has
worked on a number of VLSI projects including the Hitech chess
machine, the Apex graphics chip for drawing spline curves and
surfaces, and the Triptych field-programmable gate array. Currently he
is involved in the Chaos project building a multicomputer routing
network. His CAD interests focus on methods for optimizing the
performance of circuits using level-sensitive latches, and placement
and routing algorithms for FPGAs, particularly Triptych.
