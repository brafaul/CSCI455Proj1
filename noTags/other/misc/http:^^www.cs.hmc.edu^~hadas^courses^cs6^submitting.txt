How to Submit Your Homework



 
 How to Submit Your Homework
 



We now have a new program on osiris called submit.
Before you submit your homework, please be sure that your C++
programs end with .cc (as in my_cool_program.cc)
and that any file that just contains text (such as an essay or
written answers to a question) ends with .txt 
(as in my_answer.txt).  If your files don't end with these
suffixes, submit will whine and complain and won't deliver
your files to us.

 
You will submit each part of the homework in a separate file.
Assume that your program for problem 1 on the homework assignment
is called problem1.cc.  Then, type submit
problem1.cc.  The program will then ask you some questions.
First, it will ask you:
 
What assignment are you submitting?  
If you enter 2 that stands for Assignment 2.  Next it will ask you:
 

What problem from the assignment are you submitting?

 
If the assignment has six parts, you will enter a number between 1 and
6 in response.  Then the program will ask you if this is a first
submission or a regrade.  I'll talk about regrades in class, but for
now choose first submission.
Don't worry that the program doesn't ask who you
are or what class you're submitting a homework for.  The submit
program figures all that out by itself. (If it gets confused, it 
sends e-mail to one of the CS 5 or CS 6 professors for help.)
Similarly, if your file is a text file (not a program), just type
submit filename.txt.
