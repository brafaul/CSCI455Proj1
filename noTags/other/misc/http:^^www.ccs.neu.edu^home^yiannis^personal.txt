so), I am currently a PhD student at the Computer Science department
of Northeastern University; projected graduation date is
12/96 (confirmed). My research is on cryptography, with concentration
in electronic cash and applications, and for the last year has been
conducted at GTE Laboratories in Waltham, MA.
