Newsgroup
A newsgroup has been set up for this course:
ac.csci.b441.
It is recommended that you post all questions to this newsgroup.
If you want to know the answer to a question, chances are
someone else does, too.
Also, if you know the answer to a question someone has posted, we
encourage you to post your answer and discuss the possible
solutions. 

All of this, of course, assumes you are following the guidelines on
academic honesty. 

Format of the Lab
For the first nine weeks of the lab (except for the first lab), there
will be an assignment due at the beginning of each lab. The assignment
will typically consist of both written work and a working circuit on
your logic engine. Since the PDP-8 is such a wiring intensive project,
it will be divided into three parts with extended deadlines. In
addition to the lab assignments, you will be given a laboratory exam
relating to the PDP-8. This exam will come at the end of the semester
and will test for practical, in-depth knowledge of your circuit. 

Please note that, in general, you will be working in pairs.
All written exercises are to be handed in individually and will be
graded as individual work. You and your partner will co-operate on all
circuits, however, and will be given a single grade for your
circuitry. Because wiring experience will be shared, it is
your responsibility to make sure you understand what wiring
your partner has done and to make sure that you are doing your fair
share. You may divide up the work however you and your partner prefer,
but if we see that one of you is consistently not doing enough work,
we may re-arrange the groups. 

Laboratory Grading
The lab grade will be broken down in the following way:

 75% -- Lab assignments
 10% -- Working PDP-8
 15% -- Final exam
