 Some Facts about my recent past and my near future... 


Originally, I come from Caracas, Venezuela. and
I came to Boston in December 1995 to 
start my PhD studies.


Currently I am a PhD student in the 

College of Computer Science  at 
Northeastern University. I am working in a 
specific area of computer science some times called: Computational Science.
My goal is to work in interdisciplinary scientific projects that mix the 
knowledge from different areas (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Computer 
Science, etc.) in order to solve real-life problems.


But Computer Science is not the only thing in life that draws my attention.
I am very interested in photography as a way to express my self, in astronomy,
poetry, and music. However, as a matter of fact, it is very common not having
enough time to spend as many hours as I would like on them. 


In the near future I am going to continue doing research as part of my 
doctorate preparation and trying to find some time off!.
