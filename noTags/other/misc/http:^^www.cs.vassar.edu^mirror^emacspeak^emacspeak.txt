Emacspeak --A Speech Output Subsystem For Emacs


Emacspeak --A Speech Output Subsystem For Emacs  

 Announcing  Emacspeak, a full-fledged speech output interface to Emacs.
 

  Emacspeak is the first full-fledged speech output system that will allow
someone who cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
(Until now, the only option available to visually
impaired users has been to use a talking PC as a terminal.)
Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. Once you start emacs with emacspeak
loaded, you get spoken feedback for everything you do.  Your mileage will vary
depending on how well you can use Emacs.There is nothing that you
cannot do inside Emacs:-)

Emacspeak Mailing List

There is a mailing list emacspeak@cs.vassar.edu
that is being used to disseminate information about emacspeak. If you use
Emacspeak, you can subscribe by sending email to

greg e. priest-dorman.
See the news pagefor details on what's new in the
latest release of Emacspeak.

Description
I currently  use Emacspeak
at work on my Sparc20 workstation running SUNOS4.1;
while at Digital I used Emacspeak on my DECALPHA workstation running Digital
UNIX.
I also use  Emacspeak as
the only speech output system on my laptop running Linux.
As a useful addition,

contains the necessary files
 to make Emacs easier to use at the Linux console. 
Emacspeak currently supports the new
 Dectalk Express  
speech synthesizer, as
well as older versions of the Dectalk e.g. the MultiVoice.  On the DECALPHA,
you can use it with the software Dectalk.
(If you have a DECALPHA and also have software Dectalk installed at your site,
    please get in touch with   
Krishna Mangipudi --Digital.
    


You need GNU FSF Emacs 19 (version 19.23 or later) and TCLX 7.3B (Extended
TCL) to run Emacspeak.
 TCLX --the executable is called tcl on most systems-- is *not* plain
tcl --typically called tclsh on most systems.
See the Emacspeak distribution for additional details.


See the latest  release notes
to see what is new in the latest release.

You can  download 
Emacspeak (390K)  from this page.
 For a list of frequently asked questions about Emacspeak along with their
answers, see the Emacspeak FAQ.


Emacspeak comes with full source level documentation. There is an online info
manual as well, but this is still incomplete.
Emacs Subsystems 

Emacspeak currently has extensions for many popular Emacs subsystems
including: 



  W3: A full-fledged W3 browser
       available  by FTP
. Emacspeak implements a voice-lock mode analogous to Emacs' font-locking
       that allows it to speak WWW hotlinks using different voice
       personalities.
        GNUS: The Emacs news reader.
            Emacspeak provides a fluent extension to gnus that allows you to
            listen to Usenet news without taking your fingers off the four
            arrow keys.
         VM: The Emacs VM mail reader.
            Emacspeak works with VM to present email messages using different
            voices; Parts of a message that are cited from a previous message
            are voicifiedto produce effective aural presentations.
         Eterm: The Emacs 19 terminal emulator. (This will be part of
            Emacs 19.29).
            You can obtain a beta copy of eterm
            
            via anonymous FTP.
            I have used Emacspeak and Eterm to successfully login to work from
            my laptop and interface with running applications on my office
            workstation (including running Emacs sessions!). 


Emacspeak also works well with Emacs addons like AUCTEX for editing TeX
documents, the Emacs Calculator (CALC --a symbolic algebra system) etc. 


Emacspeak works fluently with all Emacs addons; writing an extension makes its
 use even more pleasurable. 
If you would like to write an Emacspeak addon for your favorite package please
get in touch with me so we do not end up duplicating work.
