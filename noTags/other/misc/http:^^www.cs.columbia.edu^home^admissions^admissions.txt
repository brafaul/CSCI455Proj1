Applying to an Undergraduate School


The university
has 4 major undergraduate schools:
Columbia College,
Barnard College,
the School of Engineering and Applied Science,
and the School
of General Studies.
Each school has its own application procedure, however 
online information is centralized under the following webpage:
Applying to Columbia. 
Most (but by no means all) of the CS majors are from the School of Engineering
and Applied Science, and so here is a link to their admissions webpage:
SEAS Undergraduate Admissions

Application to the Ph.D. is both very competitive, and research oriented.
You are strongly advised to spend effort finding out about the
research here at Columbia, and
in particular thinking about which 
faculty members share your
research interests.
The main sources of information are the Faculty Research Guide (HTML) (Postscript)
and research group homepages.
You should also feel free to contact potential advisors, and request
information on their recent research and publications.

(PostScript 148.8K). Other information about the Ph.D. program, such as
qualifier syllabi, may be found under the
