Important Announcement:
Final Exam will be on May 9, 1996 (Thu) from 5-7p in the same class room.
It will cover all the material covered in class lectures and
homeworks upto the last lecture on May 2.
It will be a closed book exam.

Important Announcement:
Final homework solutions will be posted 
on the course homepage on May 2 (last day of class).  So if you intend
to turn in this homework and have not yet done so,
you must turn it in latest by May 1.

In order to not lose a lecture and cover more material,
I have decided not to offer any midterm.  Midterm weight
will be added to the final exam. 
Homework weight stays the same.

Homework/Exam Policy

Weightage for final grade:


Homeworks: 30 percent

No Mid-term

Final: 70 percent


Note-1:

All homeworks regardless of their total points will carry EQUAL
weight in the final grade.


Note-2:

Please note that a good on-time homework record can boost
your final grade, if you are on the fence.


Note-3:

Homeworks may be emailed to the TA (fangzhe@cs.nyu.edu).
For those of you who submit hardcopy homework (instead of email'ing
a soft copy):

If you plan to return the homework outside the class
and office hours, please make arrangements with the TA
(fangzhe@cs) and leave it in his mailbox instead of mine.



Assigned Homeworks

Homework-5:     Due: Apr 25 (points same as in Text)


5.1 - 5.16 (You can use Fig. 5.47 in Prob. 5.7)

6.1-6.3, 6.8-6.9

I strongly urge you to go through the example on pp. 389,
covering Figs. 6.25 to 6.29.


Homework-4:     Due: Apr 4 (points same as in Text or shown in large brackets)


4.1 - 4.19

4.26 - 4.30

4.39, 4.41, 4.42

Using the algorithm in Fig. 4.41, carry out the following addition in binary:
-0.625 + 1.4375. Assume 5 bits of precision (4 bits after decimal). You
must show all steps. [10]

Using the algorithm in Fig. 4.43, carry out the following multiplication in 
binary: -0.625 x 1.4375. Assume 5 bits of precision (4 bits after decimal). You
must show all steps. [10]


Homework-3:     Due: Mar 21 (points shown in large brackets)



Text B.7 [15]


Text B.8 [15]


Text B.12 [15]


Consider the following gate called
IMPLICATION gate which implements the following
function: C = A -> B :


A=F, B=F => C=T

A=F, B=T => C=T

A=T, B=F => C=F

A=T, B=T => C=T


a) Can you build an invertor using this gate? [5]

b) Is this gate universal? Explain your answer. [10]


[I added this problem beyond the ones mentioned in class on 3/7]

Using the laws of Boolean algebra on page B-6 (without using
truth tables), prove the following:


These are known as "Consensus Theorems": [10]


XY + X'Z + YZ = XY + X'Z

(X + Y) (X' + Z) (Y + Z) = (X + Y) (X'+ Z)

Note-1:  X' refers to complement or invert of X, and so on.

Note-2: The redundant term "YZ" or "(Y + Z)" are also called 'consensus'

Note-3: Earlier (prior to Mar 18) part 2 had a typo.
The correct third term is (Y+Z).  It was mistyped as: (Y'+Z).
However, Note-2 had the proper redundant term.


Use the consensus theorems to prove the following: [15]

ABCD + B'CDE + A'B' + BCE' = A'B' + BCE' + ACDE


Use the consensus theorem to prove the following addition theorem: [10]

(X + Y) (X' + Z) = XZ + X'Y


Use the theorems above to show: [20]

(A + B + C') (A + D' + E) (A + B + D) (A' + C)
= AC + A'BD' + A'BE + A'C'DE



Show the PLA implementation (similar to Figs. B.6 or B.7) of the following
functions: [10]


F1 = A'BD + ABD + AB'C' + B'C

F2 = C + A'BD

F3 = BC + AB'C' + ABD



Text B.13 [15].


Using D flip-flops and other combinational logic elemnts, if needed,
construct the following:


A 4-bit counter which has the following counting sequence: [10]
0001, 0010, 0100, 1000, 0001, ...


A 4-bit register which has the initial content of 0000 and shifts left
a '1' on each clock tick, starting at the least-significant-bit
position. [10]


A 4-bit register which has the initial content of 0000 and shifts right
a '1' on each clock tick, starting at the most-significant-bit
position. [10]

Note: Prior to Mar 18, there was typo here and it incorrectly said:
'least-significant' instead of 'most-significant'.  You cannot
shift right starting as least-significant-bit position!



Modify the state diagram in Fig. B.28 for the following modifed
traffic controler: [15]

North-South road has priority over East-West road. So, NSlite
should normally be green and trun to red only if a) there
is a car waiting on E-W road and there is no car on N-S road,
or, b) there is a car waiting on E-W road for more than 4 mins.
The EWlite should turn to red if there is no car on E-W road.
or if there is car waiting on N-S road for more than 2 mins.



Homework-2: Due: Mar 7
(points same as the problem rating given in Text)


All problems from the Text, Chapter 3:


3.1 through 3.8

3.12 through 3.22

3.26

3.37 through 3.38



Homework-1: Due: Feb 22 (points shown in large brackets)



Problem 1:

Exercise 1.A on slide-11 of class-1 notes [5]



Problem 2:

Repeat Problem 1 with the two cost-model improvements
suggested in slide-11 of class-1 notes. [5]



Problem 3:

Text 2.14 [10], 2.15 [5], 2.16 [10], 2.17 [5], 2.18 [5], 2.19 [10]



Problem 4:

Repeat the class example (slide 26) with System-3
execution times for normalization, i.e., using System-3
execution times as the relative measures of workloads.
In other words, you need to calculate average execution rates
(normalized with respect to System-3 execution times)
of the four systems using unweighted and weighted
versions of arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means.
Note that the  workload represented by program i,
i.e., wi will be given by its execution
time on System-3, i.e., ti3.
