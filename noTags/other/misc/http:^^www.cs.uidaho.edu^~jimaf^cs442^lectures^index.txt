CS 442/542: Computer Security Concepts Lectures


CS 442/542: Lectures 

Lectures are 1 hour on Mon, Wed and Fri of each week.

I am going to try to make available notes and comments from each lecture.
If there is any material that I did not explain well, or you would like
written down, let me know and I'll add it to these pages. The following
lecture notes are postscript (PS) copies (2 per page) of the slides I show in
class. I also include pointers to Microsoft Powerpoint Files (PPT) for
those without a postscript printer or viewer. Please see the viewing information file for more information
about viewing documents found here.

    Postscript or 
    Powerpoint format
Lecture 2 (Aug 28):
