If you are wondering what
we are all about, here is a brief description:

Computer vision is an attempt to
decipher the environment we live in, using man made sensors such as a camera,
analogous to the way we use our eyes. Using images from a sensor, computer
programs can be designed to perform diverse tasks such as face recognition,
navigation and shape recovery.
