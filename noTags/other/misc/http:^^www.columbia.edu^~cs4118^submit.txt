Name
submit - electronic submission of homework files
Synopsis
~cs4118/bin/submit -h
 ~cs4118/bin/submit [-a assignment_number] [forced_files ...]
Description
submit looks for submittable files in the current working
directory and recursively searches thorugh all directories within that
directory, ignoring all binary and potential backup files.  Upon
confirmation from the user, submit copies, archives and
compresses files, and stores them privately in the class account (~cs4118).
Mail confirming the files submitted is sent to the user.      
 If you resubmit an assignment, your old assignment is moved to a backup
location.  If you resubmit more than once, only your last two submissions
will be kept.  You will be asked whether you really want to resubmit your
assignment.
 A number (1-9) can be used with the -a option to specify a
particular homework which is being submitted.
 forced_files are forced into submission even if they would
ordinarily be ignored.
 Usually the user will not need to specify forced_files or
assignment_number.  The submit program will submit the current
due assignment if the -a is not specified.
Options

 -h
 Help option.  Shows options for the program.  Does NOT perform
a submission. 
 -a
 Submit a certain assignment, other than the one currently due.

Notes
It is generally a good idea to create a separate subdirectory for each
of your homeworks.  In these homework directories will be any makefiles,
READMEs, C sources files header files and sample executions.  To submit
these files just run submit from within the corresponding
homework directory.
Return Values
Upon successful submission, the user is notified, via email, of the
successfully submitted files.  Upon failure, the user is instructed to
notify the submit administrator of the error codes.

Example
Warnings
Be sure to be on a machine on the CUNIX cluster.
 Because of incredible loads on the CUNIX cluster close to
submission times, you should leave yourself ample (+30 minutes) time to submit
your assignments.  The running time of the program should be less than 1 minute
for normal-sized submissions.
 Deadlines are enforced by the submission program, and timing is
enforced by the CUNIX cluster machines' clock.  Not by your
watch, or cs cluster machines.
 All submissions are logged.
