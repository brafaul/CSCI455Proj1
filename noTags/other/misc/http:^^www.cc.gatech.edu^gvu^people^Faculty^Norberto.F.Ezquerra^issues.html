Technical and Scientific Issues

The emphasis of research investigations is placed on real systems: i.e.,
physically realizable structures and processes. Consequently, the visualization
process embraces both real (acquired) and synthetic (modeled) information
systems. These considerations lead to a number of important and challenging
issues and problems:

How can multidimensional information fields be effectively visualized?
How can specific information be properly extracted from these
    multidimensional data sets?
What are appropriate mechanisms for organizing, representing, and analyzing
    the extracted information?
What mathematical and computational techniques can be used to create
    realistic models of the underlying geometric structures or dynamic
    processes?
How can these models be manipulated interactively?
Can visual reasoning mechanisms be formulated computationally to facilitate
    the interpretation of this information?
How can complex visualization models, or interpretations of these models,
    be communicated easily and unambiguously to someone else?
What constitutes a good (or better) interactive visualization?
