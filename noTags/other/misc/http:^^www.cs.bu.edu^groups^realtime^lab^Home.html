Pharos.bu.edu
    Pharos, a SPARCstation-10 with 34 megabytes of memory and 6
    GigaBytes of Disk Space, is the file server for a VME-based
    real-time environment that consists of 4 single-board MicroSparcs,
    each with 8 megabytes of memory. Pharos runs full-blown Solaris
    (Sun Microsystems Inc. SunOS 5.3), whereas each of the 4
    single-board machines are to be used with a tailored real-time
    version of Solaris. These 4 single-board machines could be
    configured to run as a tightly coupled shared-memory multiprocessor
    system (using VME backplane communication) or they could be
    configured to run as a loosely coupled message-passing
    multicomputer (using Pharos' LAN). Pharos itself provides an
    additional access to the department's LANs.

Departmental Facilities

Computing Resources

    Unix/Solaris Machines,  Macintosh
    Machines, and  dozens of workstations.
