Current Status
  I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant (PhD) in the
department of Computer Science, Columbia University, New York City.  I am a
member of the database research group and am currently working on some view
maintenance problems using SYBASE as a platform for my experiments.




Education
  B.S in Computer Science from Indian Instiute of Technology,
Madras, India in 1995. 



Skills
 


 Operating Systems: SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.x, BSD, DOS.



 Languages: C, Pascal, Lisp, C++, 80x86 assembly



 Databases: Worked on Oracle and Sybase.




Past Projects
 


 A database for library management using Oracle RDBMS. Included in it
 were provisions for maintaining details of faculty, students and employees.
 Retrieval and updation was made possible through a friendly user interface
 implemented using SQL-Forms.



 Implementation of some of the routing algorithms for the Network Layer. This
 was done as part of a project to develop a layered protocol suite confirming
 to the OSI model.



 A compiler for a subset of the Pascal programming language using the compiler
 building tools lex and yacc.



A mathematical package for scientific use. This included matrix operations,
curve fitting, interpolation, integration, calculator, graph plotter, solving
equations using Newton-Raphson method, solving simultaneous linear equations,
fft among others. Among the facilities provided were a friendly user interface
and editing, loading and saving files.



 Design of an 8031-based card that receives data from an RS232C serial port
 and transfers data to a parallel printer port (Centronics interface).



I have done the following in DOS environment


        - A memory testing worm that checks a segment by replicating itself.


        - A utility which provides file transfer, talk between two PC's
	connected by serial port with a friendly interface to set the baudrate
          and other parameters.


       -  A restricted DOS-like operating system using BIOS calls. It comes
          up before DOS and provides a monitor for viewing/modifying
	  registers/memory locations in addition to handling the disk
	  operations, loading and executing an executable file in a controlled
	  way.


        - A TSR Alarm program
