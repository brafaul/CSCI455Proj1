 The Vision and Misson of the IEEE Technical Activity Board  

Our vision is to provide leadership and structure to enable and
support activities relating to technical innovation, exchange of
technical information and services, for the benefit of providers and
users of all aspects of computing technologies worldwide.

 
Our mission is, by the year 2000, to establish Computer Society
technical activities as the pre-eminent source of innovation,
information and services in current technical areas, and to push the
envelope of computing technologies and applications into areas
currently unexplored.
