Designing the User Interface, Second Edition
    Designing the User Interface, Second Edition


by Ben Shneiderman



The most complete and current introduction to user
interface design available.  For anyone who needs
to understand the complex interaction between humans
and machines


With characteristic enthusiasm and vision, the author
carefully discusses the underlying issues, principles,
and empirical results, and describes practical guidelines
and techniques necessary to realize an effective design. 
System designers, programmers, software developers, and 
product managers will find the book a valuable resource
for making their systems easier to learn, easier to use,
and more productive.

Coverage includes the human factors of interactive
software (with added discussion of internationalization
and users with disabilities), interaction styles (menu
selection systems, command languages, direct manipulation),
design considerations (including response time, system messages,
screen design, and color), and methods to develop and assess 
the user interface.

Shneiderman also provides new or expanded coverage of
virtual/artificial reality, graphical user interfaces, 
user interface management systems, computer supported 
cooperative work, natural language, window management,
multimedia and hypertext, and dynamic data visualization.
The book concludes with a provocative discussion of the
social and individual impact of user interface design.
