 The University, in scheduling classes on religious holidays, intends that students observing these holidays be
 given ample opportunity to make up work. Faculty members who wish to observe religious holidays will arrange
 for another faculty member to meet their classes or for canceled classes to be rescheduled.

 Classes will be held on the Veterans' Day Holiday.

 The calendars for the School of Law, School of Medicine, and School of Dental Medicine are published separately
 and are distributed by those schools.
