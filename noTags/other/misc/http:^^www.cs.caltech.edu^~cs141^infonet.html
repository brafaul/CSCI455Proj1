The info.net package
The source is at ufs/info/classes/ for the stuns and vlsi lab.  It is
/net/info/classes/ for the ugcs cluster (sgis).  A suggested classpath
would be:

	/ufs/info/classes:.

to get it all to work.   Note the change! We had
/ufs/info/classes/jdk.zip in the CLASSPATH as well but that is
incorrect for multiple architecture support in java.  You need not
include the base java classes explicitly in your CLASSPATH, they
are added automatically from the install location of your runtime.

Documentation for the source is here.
The docs for the info.net package itself is here.
