 Course Policy:
    Friday, October 25, is the last day to drop this course.  No make-up exams
    will be given except for university sanctioned excused absences.  Homework
    assignments will not be accepted after the due date.  Hand in whatever you
    have finished on an assignment on the due date for partial credit.  If you
    must miss an exam (for a good reason), it is your responsibility to contact
    me before the exam.  Leave a message at the above number or send me email.
    

    You are to do the assignments without collaboration.  You can ask me
    questions about any aspect of an assignment.  General discussion with others
    on the system or on an approach to a problem is constructive and is okay.
    However, since your grade is based on your assignments, they must be your
    own work.  Students who hand in programs or written assignments which are
    identical or nearly identical are cheating.  This type of scholastic
    dishonesty usually results in immediate failure in the course and can lead
    to additional disciplinary action.
