Fill-Out Form Example #1
Fill-Out Form Example #1

This is a very simple fill-out form example. 


A single text entry field goes here:  

Note that it has no default value. 

To submit the query, press this button: . 


That's it. 

Things you may want to note: 

 Characters like "&", "%", and "$" in the text typed into the
     text entry field are automatically escaped (into hex form: a
     percent sign followed by a two-digit hex value corresponding to
     the ASCII value of the character) when the query is constructed.
     For example, the string "&%$" becomes "%26%25%24".
 By default, an INPUT tag corresponds to a text entry
     field.  The TYPE attribute lets you change this --
     the "submit" type indicates a special pushbutton that causes the
     query to be submitted when it's pushed.  Other types are
     demonstrated in the other examples.
 Because this fill-out form contains only a single text entry
     field, the query can be submitted by pressing return in the text
     entry field (as well as by pressing the "Submit Query" button).

Forward to example 2.
