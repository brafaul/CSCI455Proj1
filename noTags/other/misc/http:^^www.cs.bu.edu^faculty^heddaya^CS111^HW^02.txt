Homework 2---due Tue 94.09.27
		


Unless otherwise noted, please submit a listing of each program you
write for this homework, and one script that shows that all
of your programs compile properly, and run as intended.

Problems labelled as "Extra-credit/Honors" are required only of honors
   students, and are optional for everyone else.

As usual, homeworks are due at the beginning of class.

		

The following program writes a large letter I on the
screen:

	#include <stdio.h>

	#define HEIGHT 17

	main()
	{
		int i = 0;
	
		printf("\n\nIIIIIII\n");
		while (i < HEIGHT)
		{
			printf("  III\n");
			i = i + 1;
		}
		printf("IIIIIII\n\n\n");
	}



   Type, compile, and run this program

		
   Describe in a sentence or two of your own words what the program
      does.

		
   Write a similar program that prints a large letter C
      on the screen.

		


(Extra-credit/Honors)
Write a program that prints an X (the letter) that is 25
   lines high, using as few printf statements as you can.


[KP92, page 35, problem 4]
In this problem, you need only submit a hand-written list of the
   compilation errors generated as a result of each of the
