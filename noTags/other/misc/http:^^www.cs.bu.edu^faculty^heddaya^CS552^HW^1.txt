Run the command "csmail -a cs552" on the csa
   computer.
This will add you to the class mailing list, which I (and hopefully 
   you too) will use to distribute late breaking homework information
   and course-related tidbits.

		
Read and review any paper on Operating Systems from the following list
   of publications.
Your review should be one page long, with one third of it being
   devoted to a critique of the original paper.
(See the  reviewing guidelines.)

		
   ACM Transactions on Computer Systems.
		
   Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles
   (available as special issues of Operating Systems Review).
		
   ACM Transactions on
   Programming Languages and Systems.
		
   ACM Computing Surveys.
