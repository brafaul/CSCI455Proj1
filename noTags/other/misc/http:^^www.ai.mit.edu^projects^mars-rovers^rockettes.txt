The Rockettes: 10-Gram Microrovers for Mars
The Rockettes

10-Gram Microrovers for Mars

No, no, they're not golf balls!  They are an artist's conception of what a Mars landing made by a community of microrovers would look like.  The idea is that a whole bunch of very small rovers could spread out and collect data collectively. If each robot had a few sensors and were programmed to disperse around the landing area, it might be possible to gather more data than their size would suggest.
Having more than rover also allows for greater mission flexibility and reliability.  If there are two very interesting rocks in different directions from each other, a single rover would have a difficult time getting to both of them at the same time.  Also, if a few of the microrovers malfunction, there will still be enough left to complete the task at hand.

 Pebbles
    
A vision-based mobile robot that uses a single camera for obstacle
avoidance in rough, unstructured environments. Some of the potential 
applications for this research include Mars
exploration and  explosive ordnance 
disposal.
