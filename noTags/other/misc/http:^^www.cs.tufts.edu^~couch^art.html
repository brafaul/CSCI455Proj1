I am an avid amateur landscape photographer working in 35mm, medium
format, and 4x5.  Remarkably for a Computer Science professor, I work 
mainly with film and employ a minimum of electronics in pursuing 
this pastime.  Time (as well as the lack of a transparency scanner)
permits only a small sampling. I have also done a small amount of 
digital photography (with a fairly primitive
camera).
Fall 1995, Washington Grove, MD



Three images on a quiet Sunday morning lead to a suprising conclusion, 
as a jogging trail ends abruptly in a wall of hay. Fuji GS690-III, 
Ilford Delta 400, 1/125 sec at f/22, handcolored with transparent oils. 
Summer 1995, the White Mountains

A lone hiker bares all to Mount Madison, just a few feet from the Madison 
hut and oblivious to a regular stream of onlookers.

A covered bridge, near ME route 25 and `decorated' with graffiti, 
is a favorite haunt of local teenagers.

Fall 1994, Wingarsheek beach

A small stream forms as the tide rushes out. 

Sunset brings out the detail in a large tidepool.

Sand isn't always sandy; my footprints in a muddy, silty sand were deep as
my calves.

Fall 1994

An abandoned fort at Fort Point, Nahant. 


Sunset at the Nahant Fort brings out detail in the surrounding rocks and blues
the Atlantic.  


The same view as the first Nahant picture, but at an earlier time and in an
earlier light.

Cape Cod, MA.
Fall 1993, Rhode Island

An abandoned fort near Newport, RI begins the process of reclamation. 
What graffiti cannot do, lime seepage can. 

Wind-swept emplacements such as this one gradually crumble back into dust.
