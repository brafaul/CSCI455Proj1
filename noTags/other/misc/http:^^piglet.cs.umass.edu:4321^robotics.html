Some of this information is gleaned from the
comp.robotics
FAQ
maintained by Kevin Dowling,
nivek@cmu.edu.
Jonathon Fletcher's
JumpStation and random walks around the Web.

 The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for the USENET newsgroup
comp.robotics is a good place to find general robotics-related
information.  

Alternate FAQ from MIT.


There is also a Robot Competition
FAQ at NCC.
