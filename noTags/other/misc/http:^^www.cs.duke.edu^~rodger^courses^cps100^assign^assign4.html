CPS 100 - Assignment 4 - FALL 1996 


 CPS 100 FALL 1996: Assignment #4 

  Due: Monday, Oct. 28 by 8am 

  Last Date to Turn in: Monday, Nov. 4 by 8am 

 40 points 


In your cps100 directory, create a directory called assign4 using the
mkdir command. Change into the assign4 directory. 


In order to do this assignment, you need to copy some files using the 
following  cp command (don't forget the trailing period, or dot): 


       cp  ~rodger/cps100/assign4/*  .


This command will copy  files 
into your directory for you to use. 
If you type  ls you should see the following files: 
Makefile, ladder.cc, ladder.h, ladderq.cc, QueueAr.h, QueueAr.cc, 
and template.cc.


For this assignment, you'll be using a database of English five-letter
words from the Stanford GraphBase (knuth.dat, a list compiled by Don Knuth).  This
list has about 6,000 words in it.  There is a smaller file of data
to work with also called words5.dat.



In your ladder directory, create a link to these data files
by typing:



   ln -s ~rodger/data/knuth.dat  knuth.dat
   ln -s ~rodger/data/words5.dat  words5.dat


Then you can access these files without specifying a long path-name for
the files.


For the programming problem that follows, you should use the
style rules discussed in class, which includes meaningful variable names,
indentation, and  comments (pre and postconditions)
at the top of the file and for each function. Also include your name,
date, course, and purpose in a comment at the top of the program.


 Problem: Word Ladder: Turning Stone into Money 

The input to the program is the name of a word file.  The user should
then be prompted for
two words of the same length (5 characters).
The output is a sequence of words
in which consecutive words share all but one letter, starting with the
first word and ending with the last.
One letter can be changed to another letter only if the resulting
symbols form a valid word. For example, to turn stone into money, one possible
ladder is (replace 't' by 'h', replace 'o' by 'i', etc.):



stone
shone
shine
chine
chins
coins
corns
cores
cones
coney
money



All of these words can be found in the Knuth file and in a dictionary.
The user will continue to enter words, and word ladders searched for,
until either of the words entered is NOT 5 letters in length.


Assignment: Part I

You are to write a program ladderq.cc that uses a file of 5-letter
words to find the shortest ladder from one word to another using a
process outlined below.
You must develop a class to do this, the class Ladder has been
started for you,
but you will need to add more member functions (both public and private).


Your program should:

 Read and store the words from a file (specified by the user).

 Prompt the user to enter two five-letter
words (and continue to prompt), 
for each pair of words, output a shortest ladder from the first
word to the second. If one of the words is not of length 5, your program
should halt.


A sample run:


> ladderq
  Enter filename: words5.dat

  Enter two 5-letter words (length != 5 to end): smart brain

  Here is the ladder:
  smart
  start
  stark
  stack
  slack
  black
  blank
  bland
  brand
  braid
  brain

  Enter two 5-letter words (length != 5 to end): angel devil
  There is no path from angel to devil

  Enter two 5-letter words (length != 5 to end): no more
>


 
The file knuth.dat has extraneous information in it. Ignore lines that
begin with *, and only process the first 5 characters on other lines.
Knuth asks that the file not be altered, hence these restrictions.  Code
to read this file is included as the member function LoadWords,
already written for you to use.


 Algorithm 

To find the shortest ladder, you should use the templated
Queue class provided (QueueAr, the modified Queue class
from the Weiss book)
First, store all of the words from the file in a vector of
type Wnode * (this is done for you in LoadWords).


   struct Wnode
   {
      string word;
      Wnode * prev;
   };

(this assumes the use of the class string from CPstring.h.  You
can use some other kind of string if you want).


A ladder is found by putting the starting word (or rather 
a pointer to it) on
the queue, then putting all words 1 letter away from this word on the
queue, then putting all words 2 letters away on the queue, then all
words 3 letters away, etc.  As each word is taken off the queue, if the
last (target) word is found the process can stop (there may be other
words on the queue, but they'll be ignored).

A Word w isn't actually stored
on the queue, a pointer to a struct containing w
is stored.  The other field of the struct is a pointer to the word
that is one letter away from w and that caused w to be
put on the queue (the word's predecessor).  
For example, if w is house, 
then pointers to
structs containing  mouse, louse, douse, horse (and so on) are
enqueued with each struct pointing to house since this word
preceeded the others and caused them to be enqueued.  The first word
doesn't have a predecessor.  It's field cannot be 0/NULL since this is
used for another purpose.  An easy fix is to make the pointer
self-referential, it points to the struct itself (and this will need to
be checked when printing ladders).

 More Details 


The first word (entered by the user) is looked up in the list of words,
and a pointer to the struct containing the word is enqueued.  For extra
credit your program should be able to handle a first word even if the
word is NOT in the list of words (all other words in the ladder, except
perhaps for the last, must be in the list of words).


Put a pointer to the struct containing the
word onto the queue (it's a queue of Wnode pointers).  Then repeat the
dequeue/enqueue process below.


Dequeue an element (it's a pointer).  Find all words one letter apart
from the dequeued word.  If one of these is the target word, you're done
(or if one of the words is one apart from the target word you're done,
you can stop early).
Otherwise enqueue each of the words found 
if it hasn't been queued up
before (you can use the prev
pointer fields in a Wnode to determine if a word
has been enqueued before --- initially all prev fields
should be set to 0/NULL, this helps determine if a word has been
enqueued before).  This means each word is enqueued
at most once.


When the target word is derived, you'll need to print out the ladder
from the first word to the target word.  The prev pointer in
the Wnode stores information that will allow the ladder to be
recreated, you may need to use recursion or a vector since the ladder
will be backwards (but should be printed properly). Alternatively you
can store the words in an array/vector and print them out in reverse
without using recursion, but using a loop over the vector.


 Ladder Member Functions 

You must implement the functions described below.  You'll find it useful
to implement other member functions.  Sometimes the functions should be
private.  This is the case when a member function is a helper function
for other member functions, but shouldn't be called by the user.  Making
a helper function private ensures that only other member functions can
access the helper function, but client programs cannot.


 Clear(), sets all prev fields to 0/NULL.
 FindLadder(), tries to find a ladder between two words that are
parameters to the function.  FindLadder returns a boolean value
true if a ladder is found, and false otherwise.  Pass the strings to
this function as const reference parameters.
 PrintLadder() prints the word ladder.  Private data may be
needed to store the last node of the ladder (the prev field of 
the last node can be used to access all other ladder nodes, the first
node in the ladder has a self-referential pointer).


You'll probably find it useful to write a function IsOneApart()
that is used to determine if two strings are one letter apart.  To do
this, count the letters that are equal.  If this is one less than the
total number of letters in the words, the words are one apart.  This
function does NOT need to be a member function, it has two strings as
parameters (const reference) and returns true if the strings are one
letter apart.  You can just define this function in ladder.cc
and use it there.

You'll probably want debugging code/member functions to verify what's
going on.  If you build helping/debugging member functions into your
class you'll save time in the long run since the member functions can be
used to help debug code.

You may want to write a separate function to find a word in the vector
of words (pointers to words) read in.  You can write this code inline
(rather than making a function out of it), but the function can be
useful in debugging and developing.

It is advisable that you test out each function you write to make
sure it works correctly. In order to do so, it would be 
very helpful  to create a small data file with about 8 words
containing a small ladder of size 4 in it for testing. 


Using Templates

To use the templated Queue class you'll need to do use a file
called template.cc.
Template code needs to be seen by the compiler. To this end, all .h and
.cc files are #included in a separate file template.cc.
This file is illustrated below.


   #include "QueueAr.h"
   #include "QueueAr.cc"
   #include "ladder.h"


   template class Queue;



If you want several kinds of queues, just put another definition in the
template.cc file.  Once the template.cc file is compiled to template.o,
you only need to relink, not recompile, every time you make a change
in ladder.cc. This will make your recompiles much faster.


Extra Credit (5 pts)

Write a new version of ladderq.cc called ladXtra.cc.
This program
should process the words so that only "good" matches are tried when
ladders are found.  The preprocessing step will take a long time, but
word ladders will be found very quickly.

The idea is that for each word, all words one-letter away are determined
(and stored somehow) when the words are loaded. When looking for
candidate words to enqueue, only words that are one-letter away (these
are already known) are checked for previous use.  This saves searching
through the entire list of words and checking whether each is one letter
away.  


 Submitting Program 

When your programs 
compile and produce the correct output, create a "README" file
(please use all capital letters).  Include your name, 
the date, and an
estimate of how long you worked on the assignment in the "README"
file.  You must also include a list of names of all those people
(students, prof, tas, tutor) with
whom you consulted on the assignment. See the rules for collaboration
in the CPS 100 syllabus.


To submit your programs electronically type (leave off ladXtra.cc if you
didn't do the extra credit):



   submit100 assign4 README ladderq.cc ladder.h ladder.cc template.cc ladXtra.cc


You should receive a message telling you that the program was submitted
correctly. If it doesn't work try typing  ~rodger/bin/submit100 
in place
of  submit100 above.


You can submit by typing make submit (or  make
submitX  if you did the extra credit program) if
the correct README file
is in the directory from which you submit.  You can always edit the
Makefile command submit or submitX to add or change filenames.
