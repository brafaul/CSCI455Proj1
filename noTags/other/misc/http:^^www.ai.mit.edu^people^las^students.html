   Jen
       Alexander spent the summer of 1995 at MIT through the
       CRA/NSF Distributed Mentor Project.  She built a system to do
       Sound Localization in a Meeting
       Room during the summer of 1995.

   Mark Asdoorian works on Haystack.

   Joshua Reuben Brown helped develop 6.80s and 6.096 for the Rethinking CS101 project in the
       summer of 1996. 

   Dwaine Clarke works on Haystack.

   
       Michael Coen (Sc.M. 1994) works on Sodabot, a software agent
       environment and construction system.
       (Click 
here for an extended abstract.)

   Sal Desiano resurrected TJ and wrote a new parser for Natural Communication with Robots
       (part of the Cognitive
       Robotics project) in the summer of 1996.

   
       Matthew Domsch (Sc.B. 1994) TA'd the first AAAI Robot
       Building Lab at the 
       1993 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence in
       Washington, DC.  He also wrote the 6.270
       Organizer's Manual.  For more information on 6.270,
       the student-run MIT robotics course taught each January, see the
       6.270 home page.  

   Matt Eldredge supported some of our robots.

   
       Ian Horswill (Ph.D. 1993) built Polly,
       a robot that gives tours of the AI Lab.  His thesis, Specialization
       of Perceptual Processes was nominated for the ACM
       Distinguished Dissertation Award and won the MIT Department of
       Electrical Engineering and Computer Science's Sprowls Award.

   Mike Evans worked on TJ in the spring of 1996.
       
   Heji Kim spent the summer of 1995 at MIT through the
       CRA/NSF Distributed Mentor Project.  She worked on Motion Based Multi-person
       Tracking.

   Joshua Kramer works on SodaBot.
       
   Carol Y. Lee TA'd the first AAAI Robot Building Lab at the
       1993 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence in
       Washington, DC.

   Lili Liu works on Haystack.

   Antonio Mercado Jr. (Sc.M. 1988, Brown University) implemented
       Hybrid, an object-oriented language that merges delegation and
       inheritance.

   Salil
       Pitroda did his Advanced Undergraduate Project (AUP) on 
       RobotWorld for the Rethinking CS101 project in the
       spring of 1996.

   Eric Prebys works on Haystack
and the on-line bibliography project.

   Lydia Sandon works on the Rethinking CS101 project and 6.096, fall 1996.

   Brian
       Scassellati (M.Eng 1995) deduced High-level
       Perceptual Contours from a Variety of Low-level Physical
       Features (Morris Joseph Levin Memorial Award for Best
       Master Works Oral Thesis Presentation).  He intends his work to
       be part of the visual system for Cog.

   Emil Sit works on the Rethinking CS101 project, including 6.80s (summer 1996), and 6.096 (fall 1996).

   
       Ellen Spertus works on information access and the
       world-wide web.

   Maciej Stachowiak works on the Rethinking CS101 project, including 6.80s (summer 1996), and 6.096 (fall 1996).

   Nora Szasz works on the Rethinking CS101 project and 6.096, fall 1996.
       
   Tim Tang supported the SensorBots.

   
       Mark Torrance (Sc.M. 1994) taught T.J.
       to communicate (more) naturally:  "Natural
       Communication with Robots" 
       (933K).  He did a tour of duty with Cog before settling in to work on
       the Intelligent Room
       and Active
       Notebook.

   Karsten Ulland TA'd the first AAAI Robot Building Lab at the
       1993 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence in

       in the Fall of '94.

   Chuck Van Buren works on Haystack.

   
       Mike Wessler (Sc.M. 1995) built   A
       Modular Visual Tracking System.  (Click 
       here for a less formal description.)  He is now exploring
       motor control....

   Holly
       Yanco (Sc.M. 1994) worked on multiagent learning and
