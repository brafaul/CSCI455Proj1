Proxy Sharing Proxy Server Project
The Proxy Sharing Proxy Server Project

The Proxy Sharing Proxy Server Project is an investigation into the
application of wide-area demand-driven replication techniques to
sharing WWW resources.  The main difference between us and the competition
is that our caching scheme is non-hierarchial.  So far we have a
design paper,
presented in May at the ETACOM 96 conference in Portland, Oregon.
Our implementation, based on the CERN proxy server, is coming along.

 Related Work 

Interesting related research is being done at USC, where the
 Harvest Cache and Httd-accelerator 
is being developed. Another page with pointers to related work is located in
England.  Matt Welsh
has implemented a hierarchial proxy cache mechanism in only 600 lines of Perl;
his program is calld Siva.

An interesting paper that includes measurements of numerous pieces of
information on the web can be found at
