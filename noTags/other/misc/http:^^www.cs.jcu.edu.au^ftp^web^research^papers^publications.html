Technical Reports
Single copies of Technical Reports are available by anonymous ftp as
described below, by sending email to tech-report@cs.jcu.edu.au or
by writing to the Computer Science Department.

Some of the more recent technical reports are available by anonymous ftp
from ftp.cs.jcu.edu.au, in the directory pub/techreports. They are in
compressed PostScript format.  If the report title is in bold then an
ftp copy is available.  Clicking on a link will take you to the
abstract for that report.  If the report is available for ftp a second
link will be present in the abstract.

For easier searching, there is a refer database of the techreports (see
 here).
