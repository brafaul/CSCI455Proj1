My teaching activity
My teaching activity

I teach classes in Artificial Intelligence and in
Programming Languages.
When I teach Artificial Intelligence, I am mostly interested in teaching
methods for automated reasoning and their logical foundations.
In Programming Languages, the emphasis is on functional programming,
logic programming and their foundations in lambda-calculus,
denotational semantics and automated deduction.
Since the computational mechanism in functional programming is a form
of equational reasoning and the computational mechanism in logic
programming is a form of deduction in Horn logic,
the common theme of the automation of deduction underlies both my
research and teaching activities.

List of classes:


22C:023 Programming language concepts

22C:123 Programming language foundations

22C:145 Artificial intelligence I

22C:295 Seminar on artificial intelligence
