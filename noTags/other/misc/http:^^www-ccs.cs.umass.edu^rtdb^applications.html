Real-Time Active Database Applications 
Real-Time Active Database Applications 
University of Massachusetts, Amherst

Real-time database systems has been an active research area in recent
times. In spite of this, their applicability to specific applications
has not been well studied. We attempt to rectify this shortcoming by
studying two applications in detail. These applications are of
particular interest, because, a lot of concepts have been developed by
assuming certain characteristics of an application for real-time
database systems. It is not properly understood as to how these
constraints are derived from application needs. We will discuss the
data and transaction characteristics of the two applications in detail
and see if the protocols and features developed in the research have
applicability in these applications.
