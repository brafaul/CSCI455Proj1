Engines for Emergent Intelligence



Attempts to create machines exhibiting intelligent behavior can be roughly
sorted along a continuum between symbolic artificial intelligence (SAI) and
connectionist artificial intelligence (CAI).  
Symbolic AI is a
top-down approach to the engineering of intelligent behavior.  
The physical-symbol hypothesis of Newell and Simon
(1972) suggests (correctly, I believe) that human
thought can be fully described in terms of the manipulation of abstract
symbols, embodied as states in the physical world.  The common 
(mis)interpretation
(incorrect, I believe) is that symbols are discrete entities like those
found in computer programming languages (e.g. OBJECT = BIRD, COLOR = BLUE).
This is a bias due to both the computer scientist's special 
perceptual system but also the basic human perceptual system.
That mind has a physical basis is apparent.
That this physical basis can be construed as a processing of physical
symbols seems acceptable, but only if we allow a loose
definition of the word "symbol."
