Read and review any paper on Operating Systems from the following list
   of publications.
Your review should be one page long, with one third of it being
   devoted to a critique of the original paper.
(See the  reviewing guidelines.)

		
   ACM Transactions on Computer Systems.
		
   Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles
   (available as special issues of Operating Systems Review).
		
   ACM Transactions on
   Programming Languages and Systems.
		
   ACM Computing Surveys.
		
   IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.
		
   IEEE Transactions on Computers.
		
   Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Distributed
   Computing Systems.
		

Tanenbaum 2.1. 

		
Tanenbaum 2.2.  (Note: the definition in [Tanenbaum 92,
   p.34] is wrong, although the explanation is correct.)

		

Design the OS for a special purpose computer that controls the various
   components of a car.
The system would consist of CPU, RAM, multiple sensors (speed, gas
   pedal position, brake pedal position, proximity to other objects on
   the road, etc.), multiple actuators (fuel flow, fuel/air mixture,
   brakes, transmission, etc.), and multiple displays (gauges of
   various kinds).
Assume that you have a function controlCar that
   implements one step of a successive approximation control
   algorithm.
Given a set of sensor values, controlCar returns an
   approximation of the actuator parameter values, but, if it is also
   (optionally) given a previous approximation of its output for the
   same input, it returns a better approximation.
Further assume that controlCar will be the only user
   program running on your system, and that invoking it at the proper
   times with the correct inputs will be the task of your special
   purpose OS.


Your OS would have to observe the constraints imposed by the
   physical properties of the various components of the car,
   by driving convenience, and, most importantly, by the
   necessity to maintain the safety of human passengers.
The physical properties of the actuators dictate a maximum allowable
   rate of change for the actuator values.
(Some of the physical properties of the system are handled by the
   function controlCar, however the OS still needs to
   maintain basic constraints.)
Driving convenience includes such issues as the delay between
   pressing on the gas pedal and the beginning of acceleration being
   imperceptible (say 100ms).
Safety dictates that certain functions be more important than
   others, and places time limits on the allowable response times.
For example, when the driver depresses the brake pedal, the brakes
   must be applied within 10ms, for example.


A general requirement is that the OS should use the best
   approximations for the actuator values that can be obtained by
   successive calls to controlCar without violating more
   important requirements.


The main design decision for your OS will be whether to adopt a
   software architecture based on polling or interrupts, or perhaps a
   hybrid.


As part of your design, you should specify:
		

	A hardware configuration for an example system that can run your
	   OS.
	You do not need to produce a full hardware design of a system,
	  it suffices to draw a block diagram, and and point out any
	  hardware features that your OS requires.

	Formulate the constraints that your OS will deal with
	   (e.g., timing constraints and priority
	   constraints), in terms of your system in (1).

		
	Sketch the software structure of your OS.
	To do this you can use a variety of diagrams, such as block
	   structure, control flow, data flow, and execution trace
	   diagrams.
	   
		
Briefly explain how your OS works.
	What would it take to substitute different implementations of
	   controlCar?
