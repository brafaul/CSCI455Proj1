Midterm #2 A22.0002 Afternoon session 
 April 24, 1995 Samuel Marateck
 Do any 5 problems and do all the work on the exam sheet 

 Your Name

1. (20 points points) What does the following program produce as output?
PROGRAM one(input, output);
CONST Blank = ' ';
VAR J, K:integer;
BEGIN
     FOR j:= 1 TO 5 DO
     BEGIN 
         write('*':j); 
         FOR k:= 1 to (6 - j) DO
         BEGIN
            write(blank)
         END;
         writeln('*'
      END
END.


2. (20 points) Write a program that reads a number  N (an  integer)
from the keyboard and:

(a) Prints all the numbers less than or equal to   N
that are prime numbers. A prime number is one that is divisible only by 1 and 
the number itself. When a number is divisible by another number 
there is no remainder. For example, 7 is a prime number because it is not
divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Hint: Test whether the values of the loop control variable,  J
are divisors of  N.
Here are some questions that should help you
do the problem:

Is  N read before or in the loop?

If  j is the loop control
variable, what is its upper limit?

What is the test determining whether  j is a divisor
of  N?



3. (20 points) What does the following program produce?
PROGRAM two(input, output);
VAR J:integer;
    letter:char;

PROCEDURE plot(J:integer);
VAR I:integer;
BEGIN
     FOR I:= 1 TO J DO
            write('*':i);
         writeln
END {plot};

BEGIN
    FOR letter:= 'a' TO 'e' DO
    BEGIN
        J:= ord(letter) - ord('a');
        plot(j)
    END  
END.


4. (20 points) Evaluate the following (you may use the table on the board):
(a) (3 <= 7) AND NOT (9 = 8)	    (b) NOT (4 >= 5) OR (3 <= 3)

(c) NOT ((5 <= 9) OR  (3 < 2))	    (d) (6 <= 8) OR (3 > 5) OR (3 = 3)


5. (20 points) What does the following procedure produce for  plot(1,'x')?
     Procedure plot ( top : Integer; ch:char);
     Var j : Integer;
     Begin
               Case top Of
                    1 : For j := 1 To 5 Do 
                              Begin
                                   Writeln (ch:j, ch:(11 - (2 * j)))
                              End;
                    2 : For j := 5 DownTo 1 Do 
                              Begin
                                   Writeln (ch:j, ch:(11 - (2 * j)))
                              End
               End
     End;


6. (20 points) Write a procedure called  MakeX that produces 
the block letter X by using procedure  plot shown in problem 5.
The block letter should be formed from asterisks (*).
