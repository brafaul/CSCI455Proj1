Generalized Swift-Hohenberg Eqaution
MPEG movie: approximately 3M in size.

This movie was produced by students of Henry Greenside. 
The movie is a numerical simulation of
so-called spiral chaos, a novel dynamical state discovered in
convection experiments last year. The simulation is not of the full
fluid equations but of a simplified model of convection and transition
to turbulence near onset known as the Generalized Swift-Hohenberg
equation. The calculation is in a square periodic domain of size 32Pi
by 32Pi and was started from random initial conditions of low
amplitude. The movie encompasses ten horizontal diffusion times.
