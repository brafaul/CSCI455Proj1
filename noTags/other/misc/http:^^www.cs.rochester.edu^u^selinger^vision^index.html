Curve Finder






 Boundary Extraction by Lineal Feature Growing

This web page is brought to you by Christopher Eveland, Sotiris Ioannidis, and
Andrea
Selinger, a group of first year graduate students in the University of
Rochester.  In the form below, you will be able to type in the URL
of an image, and the boundaries in the images will be found,
overlayed, and sent back to you.  The boundary extraction application
was developed by 
Prof. Randal Nelson.  Click 
here if you want to see a detailed description of the application.

You can use this application if you want to find the curved
and straight lineal features in an image.  The program works on grey scale images. However, if you send us a color image we'll convert
it to grey scale, find the curves and overlay them on the color image.
You can send us your image in GIF, JPEG or IFF format. You will get it
back in GIF format.  Please allow a few minutes for the processing, as
it is being run on a busy server.

If you are ready to run the program on your image file, please use the
submission form below: Please type in the complete URL of a
GIF, JPEG or IFF file.  This file must be accessible to the outside
world.
