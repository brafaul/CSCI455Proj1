 ---Slide 1---
 The ADA Programming Language
 Language Survey 2



  Countess Ada Augusta Lovelace

 First programmer (hacker) on Babbage's  Analytical Engine.



 Relatively new programming Language (1980) developed by DoD.
Currently, the only language approved for DoD software project

 Developed to reduce high cost of  designing, 
writing and  maintaining DoD software.

 Major items of software are for `` embedded systems''


 Primary purpose is control.
   Incorporated in larger systems.
   Large software: 50,000--100,000 lines of code
   Long-lived systems (10--15 years)
   Continuously evolving.
 





---Slide 2---
 The Design History



  1975: HOLWG (High Order Language Working Group) was established
       to investigate problems of developing common language for DoD.
  1975--1978: List of requirements:
        STRAWMAN,  WOODENMAN,  TINMAN, 
       IRONMAN,  Revised IRONMAN, and finally 
       STEELMAN
 Design Competition: 
       Winner: Jean Ichbiah, Cii Honeywell Bull
  1987: Ada ISO Standard 8652
  1983--1987: Analysis of Technical Queries by ARG (Ada
       Rapporteur Group). Resulted in AIs (Ada Issues).
  1988: DOD (and ANSI) established Ada 9X project.
  15 Feb 1995: Ada 95. Core Language + Specialized Annexes



---Slide 3---
 Quick Overview (Ada 83)



 Strong Typing

       Scalar, Composite, Access, Private & Derived


 Representation Specification

 Standard Control Constructs:

       Structured Language--Pascalish


 Subprograms: Procedures & Functions

 Program Structuring Facilities: Packages

 Generics: Polymorphisms

       Extends the concept of type and functional abstractions


 Exceptions

 Separate Compilation

 Tasking (Rendezvous)




---Slide 4---
 Quick Overview (Ada 95)



 Object Oriented Programming

 Program Libraries

	(Replaces Ada 83's flat structure by a hierarchy---Visibility
	Control and Program Extension without recompilation)


 Interfacing

       Graphical User Interface (GUI)---Program Call-back.


 Tasking (Static Monitor)




---Slide 5---
 Ada Type System



 Programmer Defined Types

      Set of values, Applicable set of operations and set of properties,
      accessible via attributes


  Type Definition
   type <identifier> is <type-definition>



  Type Binding
   <variable> : <type>



   Attributes
   <name>'<attribute-identifier>




---Slide 6---
 Examples



  type DAY is (MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI,SAT,SUN);
    --Enumeration Type
 TODAY: DAY; TOMORROW: DAY; CURRENT_DAY: DAY;

 HOURS_WORKED: array(DAY'FIRST..DAY'LAST)
                    of INTEGER;

 if TODAY <= FRI then
    TOMORROW := DAY'SUCC(TODAY);

 for CURRENT_DAY in DAY'FIRST..DAY'LAST loop
    ...
 end loop;




---Slide 7---
 Primitive Scalar Types



 Discrete Types

 i) Enumeration Types, ii) Character type, 
 iii) Boolean Types, iv) Integer Types


 Real Types

 i) Fixed-Point Types, ii) Floating-Point Types


  Note:

       Integer and Real types together form the  numeric types.


 INTEGER =

      Predefined integer types
SYSTEM.MIN_INT..SYSTEM.MAX_INT


 Operation

+, -, *, / (Arithmetic operations)
<, <=, =, /=, >=, >
      (Logical operations)





---Slide 8---
 Discrete Types



  Note:

      Characters & Boolean are predefined  enumeration types

      Characters = 128 ASCII characters: 'A', 'B',
'C', 

      Booleans = FALSE & TRUE


 
       All discrete types are  ordered: FALSE <
TRUE.


 
      Discrete type values can be used for  indexing & 
iteration over loops.


 
      Attributes of Discrete Types (e.g., T )


T'POS:
 Position Number
    SUIT'POS(HEARTS) = 0


T'VAL:
 Inverse of POS
  SUIT'VAL(0) = HEARTS


T'SUCC, T'PRED


T'FIRST, T'LAST






---Slide 9---
 Real Type



 
         Floating Point: 
Accuracy is fixed by a  relative error bound

  type WEIGHT is digits 10;

Values have an accuracy of 10 digits.


 
         Fixed Point: 
Accuracy is fixed by a  relative error bound

  type VOLTAGE is delta 0.1 range 0.0..1.0;

Values have an accuracy at least as fine as 0.1.


 Some Attributes

FX = Fixed Point: ..

   FX'DELTA, FX'LARGE




FL = Floating Point:
       ; mantissa has B digits.

   FL'DIGITS, FL'MANTISSA, FL'EMAX,
  FL'SMALL, FL'LARGE, FL'EPSILON




---Slide 10---
 Derived Type



 Specific Type +  Constraints

    E.g., Range Constraints for scalar


 Examples
   subtype BYTE_SIZE is INTEGER range -2**7..2**7;
  subtype CAPS is CHARACTER range 'A'..'Z';
  subtype <identifier> is <parent-type> range <constraint>;



  Object Declaration
  X, Y: constant INTEGER range 0..128 = abs(N);
 <identifier>: <mutability> <type> <constraint>
          = <init-value>;



 
      Range constraint can be tested at runtime

   if CURRENT_INPUT not in CAPS then ...




---Slide 11---
 Assignment Statement



         X := Y;


  Types must match

 Same type name--Not structure. Ada uses  name equivalence.
   Type checking is at compile time.
   Type mismatch  
      Program considered  illegal.
 


  Subtype constraints

 Compatibility condition: type(X)  type(Y) 
   Constraint checking is at run time.
   Violation raises constraint  exception. 
     (Program is  not illegal.)
 



---Slide 12---
 Examples



   subtype NATURAL is INTEGER range 1..INTEGER'LAST;
  A: INTEGER;
  B: FLOAT;
  C: NATURAL;
  D: INTEGER range 0..INTEGER'LAST;

  A := B;              --illegal
  A := INTEGER(B);     --type conversion, legal
  A := C;              --legal
  A := D - 3;          --legal
  A := C + INTEGER(B); --legal
  C := D;              --constraint exception
  C := A;              --constraint exception




---Slide 13---
 Arrays



  Arrays in Ada:

 Fixed Size---Type may be  unconstrained at definition
But bounds must be given at object declaration.
   Elements are all of same  subtype
 Permits: Assignment, Equality Testing, Slicing, 


 subtype NATURAL is INTEGER range 1..INTEGER'LAST;
type SHORT_STRING is array(1..10) of CHARACTER;

type STRING is
     array (NATURAL range <>) of CHARACTER;

NAME: STRING(1..10);




---Slide 14---
 Array Assignment



 Assigning array B to A:  A := B
  Legal, if type of A is same as type of B.

 If A has same number of elements as B, then
B is copied into A  positionally---Otherwise, 
constraint-error exception is raised.
 

 declare
  A: STRING(1..10); B: STRING(11..20);
begin
  A := B;
end;



  Array Attributes






---Slide 15---
 Array Indexing & Slicing



 Array Indexing:
  S: STRING(1..10);
 S(3) := S(2);



 Array Slicing (1D arrays only)
  S(3..7)              --an array object
 S(3..7) := S(4..8);
 S := S(2..10) & S(1) -- & == concatenation opn



 Array Aggregates:
  type SYM_TAB is array (CHARACTER range <>) of INTEGER;
 TABLE: SYM_TAB('a'..'c') := (0, 1, 2);
 TABLE := ('c' => 2, 'b' => 1, 'a' => 0);
 TABLE := ('c' | 'b' => 1, others => 0);




---Slide 16---
 Records



  Records in Ada:

  Heterogeneous: Components need not be of same type.
   Fields are accessed by component names: E.g.,
MY_CAR.CAR_MAKE
  Variant Records Tag (discriminant) fields cannot be
changed at run-time.
   Permits: Assignment and Equality Testing.
 

  type CAR_MAKE is (FORD, GM, HONDA);
 subtype CAR_YEAR is INTEGER range 1900..1999;
 type CAR is
   MAKE: CAR_MAKE;
   YEAR: CAR_YEAR;
 end record;

 MY_CAR: CAR;




---Slide 17---
 Records (Contd)




 Records may be  nested... initialized at
declaration.
  A record B may be assigned to record A, provided
they have same type.
   A, B: CAR;
  A := B;



 Record Aggregates:

   YOUR_CAR: CAR :=           YOUR_CAR: CAR :=
     (GM, 1981);                (MAKE => GM,
                                 YEAR => 1981);




---Slide 18---
 Variant Records




 Similar to PASCAL variant records:
  Except---Type declaration only defines a template; When object
is declared,  discriminant value must be supplied.
     type VEHICLE_TAG is (CAR, TRUCK);
     type VEHICLE(TAG: VEHICLE_TAG) is record
       YEAR: MODEL_YEAR := 93;
       case TAG is
         when CAR => COLORS: COLOR_SCHEME;
         when TRUCK => AXLES: NATURAL;
       end case;
     end record;

     YOUR_TRUCK: VEHICLE(TRUCK);
     REFRIGERATOR: VEHICLE;      --Illegal


 There may be more than one discriminant...But they must all be
of discrete types....Discriminant can be used as an uninitialized
constraint.
     type BUFFER(LENGTH: NATURAL) is record
       POOL: STRING(1..LENGTH);
     end record;






---Slide 19---
 Access Types




 Allow manipulation of pointers.
  Allow control of object creation.

   type STRING_PTR is access STRING;
  type STRING_10_PTR is access STRING(1..10);
  P, Q: STRING_PTR; P10: STRING_10_PTR;

  P10 := new STRING(1..10);
  P10 := new STRING(2..11);    --Constraint Error
  P10 := new STRING;           --Illegal

  P := new STRING(1..3);       --OK
  P.all := "BUD";
  Q := new STRING("MUD");
  P := Q;
  P.all := Q.all



 new creates a new object that can be designated by the
access type.





---Slide 20---
 Recursive Types



  type NODE;  --Incomplete Declaration;
  type NODE_PTR is access NODE;

  type NODE is
    record
      DATUM: CHARACTER;
      NEXT: NODE_PTR;
    end record;



---Slide 21---
 Generalized Access Types




 Inherent Access to declared objects 
	(Not just objects created by allocators)

   type INT_PTR is access all INTEGER;

  IP: INT_PTR;
  I: aliased INTEGER;
  IP := I'Access



  Note: Designated variable must be marked aliased.
  Access attribute is only applicable to an object whose
	lifetime is at least that of the access type.
  Avoids ``dangling reference'' problem.

   type CONST_INT_PTR is access constant INTEGER;

  CIP: CONST_INT_PTR;
  C: aliased constant INTEGER := 1815;
  CIP := C'Access



 Access is restricted to read-only





---Slide 22---
 Control Structures



 Assignment Statements
      DISCRIM := (B**2 - 4.0*A*C);
     TABLE(J) := TABLE(J) + 1;
     VECTOR := (1..10 => 0);



 Conditional Statements
    if (A=1) then
     ...
   end if;                    case A is
                                when 1 => --...;
   if (A=1) then                when 2 => --...;
     --...                      when others => null;
   elsif (A=2) then           end case;
     --...
   else
     --...
   end if;




---Slide 23---
 Control Structures: Iteration Clause



 Iteration Statements---Basic Loop
   loop
    -- Statements to be repeated
  end loop;



  Iteration Clause

	Execution of a basic loop terminates when
   The iteration is completed or
     A  loop exit statement is executed



 SUM := 0;                SUM := 0;
for I in 1..10 loop      for I in reverse 1..10 loop
 SUM := SUM + A(I);        SUM := SUM + A(I);
end loop;                end loop;

SUM := 0; I := 1;        SUM := 0; I := 1;
while I <= 10 loop       loop
  SUM := SUM + A(I);       exit when I > 10;
  I := I + 1;              SUM := SUM + A(I);
end loop;                  I := I + 1;
                         end loop;




---Last Slide---
 A Complete Ada Program



   with I_O_PACKAGE;
  procedure TEMPERATURE_CONVERSION is
    use I_O_PACKAGE;
    -- Convert temp in Fahrenheit to Celsius

    FAHRENHEIT_TEMP; CELSIUS_TEMP: FLOAT;
  begin
    GET(FAHRENHEIT_TEMP);
    CELSIUS_TEMP := (FAHRENHEIT_TEMP - 32.0)*5.0/9.0;
    PUT(CELSIUS_TEMP);
  end TEMPERATURE_CONVERSION;
