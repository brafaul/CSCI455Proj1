Concepts in Programming Languages. Syllabus



CLA CS320  
Concepts in Programming Languages, Fall 1996 



The goal of this course is to provide students with a good grasp of
the structure of computer languages, which in turn provides the tools
for the students to master new languages easily.  This course covers
the principles underlying all programming languages and their
implementations.  We will apply the concepts and principles to object
oriented languages, functional languages, logic programming languages,
and network programming languages.  Specifically, we will use Java and
its language processors to illustrate these principles when they are
applied in practice.

The core topics include: language specification, objects, expressions,
control and types.  We discuss the concrete aspects of each topic
followed by implementation strategies and the related semantic issues.
We will use examples in Java, Javascript, C, C++, FORTRAN, Pascal,
Ada, COBOL, and other programming languages.

 Workload

There will be 4 homework assignments, 1 mid-term examination, and a
term project.  The requirements in the term project include (1) an
abstract, (2) a mid-project progress report consisting of a short
written report, and a project presentation with working demonstration
of initial results, and (3) a final report.  No extension on
assignments and term project.  Ten points will be deducted each day
after the due day.

The assignments will count for 40%, the mid-term exam 20%, and the term project
will make up the remaining 40% of the final grade.
