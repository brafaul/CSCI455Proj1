EECS 498-2 Assignment 3


EECS 498-2: Assignment 3
Program an Arcade Game
Assigned: September 13, 1996
Due Date: October 4, 1996



For assignment 3 you get to take your first crack at actually
programming a game.  We will provide you with code (which we'll call
the Arcade Package) which handles most of the low level messy stuff
(such as selecting the video mode, setting up a back buffer and page
flipping).  You have to design a (fairly) simple arcade game, draw the
graphics and program the inner workings of your game.  You have three
weeks to create a working arcade game, so design and software
engineer carefully to make sure you are done.  We expect a game on the
order of Centipede.

Grading Criteria

Your grade on assignment 3 will be based on 4 factors:


 Is the game fully fuctional?  
 The most important thing that we're looking for is a working
game.  If the game is almost but not quite finished or still contains
bugs your grade will suffer.  When you design your
game make sure you can finish the project within the three week time
frame.  Create a schedule and stick to it.

 Is the game nontrivial?
 You won't get a good grade if your final game is just pong with
different colors and a bigger paddle.  Your game doesn't have to be
original (i.e. a clone of a classic arcade game is fine) but it should
be something you are proud to hand in.

 Is the game well designed?
 We talked about designing a game and some of the design sins that
are commonly made.  Make sure you show us that you were paying
attention in class and learned something.

 Is your code well structured and commented?
 We will be looking at your code and the easier it is to read and
follow the better mood we will be in when it comes time to decide on a
grade.

Tools

To do this assignment you will need to use a C/C++ compiler (such as
Borland C++ 4.2 which is available on CAEN machines), the Arcade Package (which is available on the class
webpage), and a paint program (such as the Windows Paint program also
available on CAEN machines).


 C/C++ Compiler
 The Borland C/C++ compiler is available on CAEN machines and
should work well for this project.  Make sure when you create a
project you set the Platform to DOS (Standard) and the Target Model to
Large.  If necessary we may have an evening session to introduce people
to the compiler and the Arcade Package.

 The Arcade Package
 This code has been written specifically for this assignment.  It
handles all of the low level stuff that is such a pain in game
programming.  On the class website you will find a simple Pong program
which was written with the Arcade Package.  All you have to do is
replace the pong code with your game.

Notes on the Arcade Package:

 The Arcade Package is written in C and C++.
 On Wednesday half of the lecture will be an introduction to the
Arcade Package.  Please try to look the code over (and perhaps compile
the Pong program) as this will be an excellent change to ask
questions.
 Your game will be limited to 320 by 200 pixels and 256 colors.
 The arcade package is somewhat object oriented.  You will be
creating game objects (i.e. paddles and balls in Pong) and for each
object writing a number of functions which update the position of the
object (Update), handle collisions with other objects (You_Hit), and
draw the object (Draw).  In addition you will get input from the mouse
or the keyboard.

 Paint Program
 You will have to create graphics for each of your game objects.
You can use any paint program which creates PCX files.  The Paint
program in windows is appropriate as is the shareware program Paint
Shop Pro.

What you hand in

Three weeks from today (which is October 4th) you will hand in the
following items.

 A floppy disk with your game executable.
 Printouts of all your code.
 A manual for your game.
 A write-up containing an explanation of your code (what the data
structures are and how the program is organized) and anything special
that you would like to point out to the grader.

We will then begin the grueling task of playing all your games.

Additional Notes

 If you have questions about the Arcade Package please bring them
up in class or email them to both vanlent@umich.edu and
mikeott@umich.edu.

 If bugs are found in the Arcade Package we will announce them in
class and on the class webpage.  If you are having a problem please
check the webpage before emailing for help.

 Half of class on Wednesday will be devoted to explaining the
Arcade Package.  Please don't miss this class.  If you are absolutely
unable to make it we might be able to set up an appointment to cover
the material.
