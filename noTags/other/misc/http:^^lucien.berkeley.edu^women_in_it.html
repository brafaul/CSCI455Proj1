Web-sters' Net-Work

Women in Information Technology
SHAMELESS PLUG:  You haven't bought a copy of
Wired_Women:
Gender & New Realities in Cyberspace?  Then stop staring at
this dopey web browser and go buy it NOW!!!

"Webster  n [(derived fr. OE webbestre female
weaver--Webster's): "A weaver ... as the designation of a
woman"--O.E.D.] : A woman whose occupation is to Weave, Esp a
Weaver of Words and Word-Webs.  N.B.: The word Webster
was Dis-covered by Judy Grahn, who has written: "Webster is a word
that formerly meant "female weaver," the "ster" ending indicating a
female ancestor, or female possession of the word.  The word-weavers
of recent centuries have given us the oration of Daniel Webster and
the dictionary listings of Merriam-Webster stem from English family
names that once descended through the female line.  Some
great-great-grandmother gave them her last name, Webster,
she-who-weaves.""-- Websters' First New Intergalactic Wickedary of
the English Language, conjured by Mary Daly in cahoots with Jane
Caputi.


I'm hoping to have this page provide an annotated list of sources 
relating to/useful for women in the fields of library & information science,
computer science, and information technology (particularly those still
enmeshed in the halls of academia).  If you know of any other
sources that you think ought to be here, or want to make other 
suggestions on the page's presentation or organization, please send me mail at
jmcd@lucien.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU.  Thanks!

programs and related info.
Sources for women's studies/feminist information on the Internet
Provided by Laura Hunt (formerly of the SLIS program at Univ. of Michigan),
this page provides a guide for those conducting feminist or women's studies
research on the Internet.  Particularly good place to look for 
Listservs relating to feminism and women's studies issues (see also
Amy Goodloe's site listed above, and Joan Korenman's regularly updated
compilation of women-related lists in the Newsgroups & 
Lists section below).


BIBLIOGRAPHIES

Archives of Women in Science and Engineering
Located at Iowa State University Library
(inaugurated in 1994), the archives exist "to document the history of women in
science and engineering--their social history as well as the story of
their scientific achievements.  Allied with Iowa State's Program for 
Women in Science and Engineering, whose goal is to
encourage women to become scientists and engineers in the future, the
Archives will document the lives and careers of those who have achieved 
this goal in the past. The Archives collects widely in all
fields of engineering and in the physical, earth, life, and
computational sciences, though not in medicine."  An excellent
resource for those researching the history of women's history in the
sciences in this country.
The History of Women and Science, Health, and Technology
Available through the U.C. Berkeley Library gopher, this bibliography
was published by the Univ. of Wisconsin System Women's Studies Librarian.
It is organized into six parts: 1. Overviews; 2. Women in the Scientific
Professions; 3. Health & Biology; 4. Home Economics/Domestic Science; 
5. Technology; and 6. Children and Young Adult Literature.  The bibliography
was prepared "to aid colleagues in both designing new gender-centered 
courses and integrating feminist scholarship into existing survey courses...
[and] to make the history of women in the professions more accessible to 
practitioners in the various branches of science, medicine, and technology."
feminist information system design &
research
The original version of this bibliography (compiled by Helena
Karasti?) came from the English Server.
  I intend to start adding on to a local version of this
as I find works pertaining to information system design from a 
feminist perspective.
Women and Information Technology: An Annotated Bibliography
A very nice, comprehensive annotated bibliography put together by 
the WITS colloquium at the University of Illinois.  Highly recommended if you want a broad
perspective on all issues effecting women and their interactions with
technology.  My only complaint is I wish that had enabled a form of access
which didn't make you go through the pages sequentially.  Jerry's tip of
the day: if you go to http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/wits/ you'll get a
directory listing which includes all of the bibliography pages.  Helpful
if you want to skip around a little within the bibliography.
Gender, Sex and
Sexuality
While not strictly speaking a bibliography, The English Server 
has a page devoted to Feminism and Women's Studies, and Gender Studies 
and Queer Studies (including several interesting articles on gender
and technology).  Be sure to check out Feminist Use of Cyberspace
by Ellen Balka, as well as the information on the International Network
of Women in Technology (see the entry for WITI under professional
organizations below for more information).

E-PRESS

Women Online
A joint venture between Women Online founder Amy Goodloe and WWWomen co-founder Kathleen McMahone, Women Online is intended to provide articles by and about prominent women online, regular features on online content, and "how to" tips for the WWW technically-inclined.  Interactive forums are also available through the site.
BRILLO Extra Abrasive
A publication which appears to be tackling head-on the issue that
the Internet is male-dominated sphere (and a rather viciously
maintained one at that).  Here's their initial description from their press release:
Brillo is an electronic magazine challenging the exclusion of 
white women and people of color from new technologies.  We hope to show 
that there are people and organizations out there changing how we think 
about technology in significant and productive ways.  And we're not just 
talking about the Internet and the WWW, but about how talented, brave 
people are challenging paradigms of all kinds -- paradigms that actively 
exclude "minorities" from a broad spectrum of cultural activites and 
pursuits -- from the media to business to electronic resources.  We hope 
that we can provide not simply ideology, but practical examples and 
models of how these paradigms can be changed and how we can create 
useful alliances to effect substantial social change.  Always aggressive 
and always abrasive, this first issue of Brillo, "Armed and Dangerous," 
seeks to empower and inform the 15.5%.  (Statistic from the Guerilla 
Girls - The Internet is 84.5% male.)

The initial isue consists mainly of interviews, including interviews
with Daria Ulunga from Plugged In, DeeDee Halleck from Paper
Tiger Television, and Brandee Amber Selck of IUMA.  Worth
watching, particularly if they expand editorial content to include
non-interview materials.
Pilgrim New Media
"Pilgrim New Media is a multimedia developer and publisher that
specializes in creating CD-ROM titles on topics of particular interest
to women."  Their first title, Her Heritage, is a
biographical encyclopedia of famous american women (yes, Grace Hopper
is in there).  And since, we are librarians here at
Web-sters', we should note that Her Heritage was named one of
the top seven Best CD-ROMs of 1994 by Library
Journal.  A commercial site worth keeping an eye on.
Women's
