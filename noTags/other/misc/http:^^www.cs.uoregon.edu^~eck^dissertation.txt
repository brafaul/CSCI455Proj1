 DOCTORAL DISSERTATION 
  FINALLY!!  , as promised, an electronic version of my recent doctoral dissertation, titled: 

An Empirical Comparison of Copresent and Technologically-Mediated Interaction based on Communicative Breakdown  


(And for all of you that have contacted me for a copy, thanks for your patience...)

FIRST, click here to read just the abstract.


THEN, if you're sufficiently interested, you can 
download a Binhexed Word for Macintosh
version of the complete dissertation.

OR you can download a postscript 
version (2Mb). Note that postscript has sometimes been a problematic format
 for me; Let me know if you have any trouble with it.

ANOTHER easy way to get a copy of the dissertation is to request it from the University of Oregon 
computer science department; the dissertation is available (free of charge) as technical report CIS-TR-96-01.
Just click here to send a mail message
 to Ms. Jan Saunders, who is responsible for distributing tech. reports, and
ask for report number CIS-TR-96-01.

A SHORT SUMMARY! If you want a good overview of the dissertation results, but don't have the stomach for reading the whole thing, you may be interested in the draft 
of a paper derived from the dissertation work: 
As a Postscript file .

Again, please contact me if you have
any difficulties downloading any of these files.
