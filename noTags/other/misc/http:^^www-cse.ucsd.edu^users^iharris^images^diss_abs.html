Abstract of Dissertation Prospectus


As device sizes continue to diminish, the chip gate-to-pin ratio
increases, reducing chip testability. The strong effect of testability
on production cost makes it imperative that it be well integrated into
the VLSI design process. High-level synthesis automates the design
process, allowing design alternatives to be explored more efficiently.
The importance of testability necessitates exploration of test options
during the design process as early as possible.

The increasing complexity of chip circuitry increases the cost of
production by causing test time to rise, thereby reducing production
throughput. For this reason, it is necessary to generate designs which
deliver high fault coverage with low test time. Chip performance is a
critical constraint for any high speed application area such as real
time digital signal processing which is used in almost any multi-media
application. The inclusion of testability into a design often causes a
severe performance degradation. Since testability is also
important for such designs, it is necessary to include testability
with minimal impact on the chip performance. Low test time and reduced
performance degradation must be achieved simultaneously during the
design of a testable system.


The chief component of test time is the degree of allowable test
concurrency between the testing of different parts of the chip. Two
chip components may not be tested concurrently if the tests which
examine the two components share hardware. In order to minimize test
time, designs must be generated which allow tests to be defined which
share hardware as little as possible. Performance is reduced when test
registers are inserted into delay-critical paths of the design. Test
registers must be inserted to ensure testability, while avoiding the
delay critical paths of the circuit. Once a testable design has been
generated, tests must be defined for that design which are
parallelizable. 

I will design a system which performs three tasks with the goal of test
time minimization:



Definition of a circuit which is testable with a high degree of
test concurrency, from a behavioral description.
 Insertion of test registers into the defined circuit to allow
the definition of parallelizable tests while minimizing the degradation
of chip performance.
 Definition of a highly concurrent BIST test plan for the circuit.


The work presented here will be applied to a wide range of Built-In
Self-Test (BIST) methodologies. By altering the area overhead
limitation, the designs produced by this system can range from fully
centralized BIST, where all chip components are tested by the same test
registers, to partially distributed BIST, where the degree of test
register sharing is restricted. 

The cost of chip testing has become a large fraction of chip
production cost and the effect of test register insertion on
performance is critical for any high speed application. The need
for an integrated system which considers test time and performance
reduction due to testability at the earliest stage of design is clear.
Previous efforts to increase testability neither integrate the
different levels of testable circuit design nor directly address the
problem of minimizing test conflicts and performance degradation in a
computationally efficient way.
