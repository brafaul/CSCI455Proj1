Be able to select an appropriate software development life cycle for a project
Know the development processes required in a typical software development project and be able to select 
development processes appropriate for a specific development project.
Be able to plan a software development project including:
   
identifying key processes and their interdependencies
   identifying documentation needs
   preparing a detailed project schedule
   estimating project resources and costs
   
Be able to recommend an effective project organizational strategy for a specific development project
Be able to effectively monitor a software development project
Be able to perform a software project risk assessment
Understand the relationships between software development activities/organizations and other 
activities/organizations within the enterprise
Understand social and environmental factors that contribute to or hinder software development activities

     Individual Project           20%
     Final Exam                   10%

Undergraduate and graduate sections of the course are graded separately.
Due to slightly different schedules, off-campus and on-campus sections
are graded separately.  The difference between the undergraduate and 
graduate versions is in the expected level of accomplishment.  Because of
additional academic study and work experience, graduate students should be 
able to provide greater insight and depth of discussion in all phase
of their course work.  Just as an example, my expectations for the amount
of effort put into the individual project is substantially higher for
graduate students:  5-10 pages for undergraduates, versus 15-20 pages
for graduates.
Participation
All students are expected to make a regular contribution to the class.
On-campus students should be prepared to offer their comments regarding 
material presented, ask interesting questions during class, and respond
with good answers to questions asked in class.  Calling to my attention
a high quality article on a topic discussed in class, pointing out
an interesting WWW site, relating a personal experience,
etc. are encouraged.  Off-campus students should also do these things
and communicate with me on a regular basis using e-mail, fax, telephone,
or mail.  I'm particularly interested in hearing your perspective
as practitioners.  A meaningful contribution each week is considered
a satisfactory level.  A portion of some class sessions will be devoted
to discussion and feedback based on questions and comments supplied
from off-campus.
Term Project
The course also requires an approved term project that should be a 
practical application of some concept(s) studied in the coruse.  The
project is expected to be more extensive for graduate students than
for undergraduates.  For example you might base your project around
preparation of a Software Project Management Plan that follows IEEE
standards, review published literature on software risk assessment
and prepare a report, or study software process metrics from your
organizztion.  You are expected to propose a topic and receive my approval
before starting.  Additional guidelines will be provided.
Assignment (exercises)
Several exercises will be assigned during the semester.  Most of 
these will be individual assignments, however, one group assignment
is anticipated.
