 Odds & Ends 


Odds & Ends
This would be the bit with a number of links that I find
interesting.
Here are a few of my interests:


Villanova
basketball, the Wildcats!
  Delaware football (gotta love the name: Fightin' Blue Hens
)
  Reading.  (Tolkien,

Asimov, Douglas Adams, and a variety of others)  
  Soccer.  Until Philadephia gets a team, I'll be routing for the
New England Revolution.
Chess -- Here's a Chess server in Warwick, England.  I'm not
actually all that good at chess, I just like to play.
  Oh, and, as you probably guessed, computers.

Take a  peek at the ACM's home
page.  (That's the Association for Computer Machinery.)

A couple of my favorite sights:

Yahoo!
Jumbo
Sierra
LucasArts
