Benjamin Watson International Experience

International Experience


As noted above, I am ACOG's Associate Envoy to 
Liechtenstein for the
1996 Olympic Games.  
For now, this means weekly training sessions in Olympianism, Olympic Village 
orientation, and international protocol. During the Games, I will spend most 
of my waking hours in the Village or at events with the team, making sure their 
needs are met.  Incidentally, Georgia Tech
is the site of the Village.

In the summer of 1993, I was the lucky recipient of a $10,000 

NSF Summer Institute in Japan  scholarship.  This is a program 
organized with the cooperation of the 

Science and Technology Agency (STA).  I visited and worked at MITI's 
AIST
Electrotechnical Laboratory,

Machine Understanding Division, in Tsukuba, Japan for two months.
While there, I studied the Japanese language, visited several Japanese 
laboratories performing research in virtual reality, studied the
Japanese language with Tsukuba University
instructors, and learned about Japanese culture.  I also took the opportunity to
visit South Korea and China.

I've reported on my journeys and adventures in Japan in the following two 
papers: 


A survey of virtual reality in Japan.  B.A. Watson (1994).  Presence:
Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, Vol. 3,1.  pp. 1-18.

Trip report: The NSF Summer Institute in Japan".  B.A. Watson (1994).  A Georgia Tech technical
report.


I've also spent one and a half years studying in Germany on an $8000 

WSF scholarship, and so learned to speak fluent German.  I studied at the 
University of Stuttgart's 
Informatik 
faculty.
