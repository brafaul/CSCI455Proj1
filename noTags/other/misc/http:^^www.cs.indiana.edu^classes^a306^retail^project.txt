A306 - Retail Store
Project
The Retail Store Project
Due at Midnight on Tuesday/Wednesday, April 30/May 1

As our main project for the semester, we are implementing
a system to manage the sales and inventory data for a retail
store. This page will serve as a jumping-off point for
information pertaining to all aspects of the project. Here
you will find links to the results of our analysis and design
discussions, descriptions of the assignments through which we
will implement the system, and shared code and implementation
hints.
How to Turn In Your Project
 Sometime before the deadline, type
~jsobel/a306/final-handin to turn in your work.  You will
be prompted for a list of file names.  List all the files you have
written for the project, including your Makefile.  If you
run the final-handin program more than once, I will ignore all the
handins except for the last one.  
Analysis and Design: Preliminary Results
Below you will find a list of the classes that we have
chosen (so far) to model the activity in a retail store. The
name of each class is a link to more information about that
class (such as the variables used to represent the state of
instances of the class and the methods used to implement the
behavior the those instances).

Person 
Customer 
Employee 
Inventory 
Item 
Tender 
Transaction 
TransactionElement 
Sale 
Return 
Store 
Company 

Assignments

Implement the Person class and the
     Customer class.
Implement the Tender classes.
Implement the Transaction class and the
     TranactionElement classes. 
Write a main driver program for the retail store.

Code and Other Helpful Resources
All links to code in the following list are really only for
reference.  You can just include the header from
~jsobel/a306/include and link with -la306 to
use the extra classes below.
