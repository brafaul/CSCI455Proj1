 Tekin Ozsoyoglu's Outside Interests 




Outside Interests of G&uumlltekin &Oumlzsoyoglu 




 Racquetball and Squash. I try to play as often as I can.

  
 Downhill Skiing.   These days, it is mostly "Holiday Valley, NY",
     and, rarely, "Killington", "Stove", or "Rockies" for us.
 
  
 Camping and Hiking. We (Meral, Aysegul (daughter), and Hazel (a 65-pound
chocolate labrador retriever)) just hiked in the Alleghany National Forest,
and loved it.
