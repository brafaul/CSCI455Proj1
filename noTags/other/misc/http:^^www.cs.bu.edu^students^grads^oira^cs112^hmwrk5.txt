 Spring Semester 1995  
 Homework Number 5


   This homework is due on April 13. There is an extra credit exercise which is
optional except for honors students.

 Consider the following array of integers :

15, 9, 7, 5, 10, 4, 2, 3, 1

   Write down the array after each iteration (recursive call) of

 Quicksort

 Merge Sort



 (Taken from ``Data Structures Using C'' by Tanenbaum et.al). A sort by
counting is performed as follows. Declare and array  count and set 
count[i] to the number of elements that are less than  x[i]. Then place
 x[i] in position  count[i] of an output array. (However, beware of
the possibilities of equal elements.) Write a routine to sort an array  x
of size  n using this method. Write a program to test your routine.

 (Extra credit.) Implement the Quicksort algorithm for two way linked
lists.
