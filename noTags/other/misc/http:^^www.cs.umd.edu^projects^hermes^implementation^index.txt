 CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS 

PLATFORMS:

            Hermes is currently supported on two platforms, the 
            Unix/X platform, and the PC/Windows platform.
	    
DISTRIBUTED IMPLEMENTATION:

            A client-server based implementation of HERMES currently
            accesses data at 9 sites worldwide across the Internet.
            Addition of a new site to the network may be accomplished
            very quickly (30 minutes).  The following information describes
            the geographic distribution of currently-participating sites.

	    
USA:   
		  Univ. of Maryland 
                      Cornell University 
                      Brown University 
                      Bucknell University 
		      TEC - U.S. Army Topographic and Engineering Center
 
	      Europe:   
		  Univ. of Calabria, Italy   
                      Technische-Universitat Wien, Austria   
                      University of Aachen, Germany

             Rest:   
		  Univ. of New South Wales, Australia

	    

            Additional sites are currently being added.

            
PACKAGES INTEGRATED:

DBMSs:  INGRES, PARADOX, DBASE, ObjectStore

	   
AI systems:
	      Feature-based Face Recognition Package  
                  Holistic Eigen-value based Face Recognition Package  
                  US Army Free Terrain Route Planner  
Misc. Software:  
	        AVIS (Advanced Video Information System)  
                    MACS (Media Abstraction Creation System)  
                    text database (newswires)  
                    spatial database (PR-quadtrees)  
                    Unix (bc, calc, ls, grep, xmosaic, xedit, etc.)  
                    Math (elementary math operations)  
                    Simulated airline reservation system.
	  

          The time taken to integrate a new package is approximately 1-2
          weeks of a full-time programmer, but could vary depending upon the
          package being designed.  Help tools for this include a 
          DOMAIN INTEGRATION TOOLKIT that may be used to integrate software at
          the systems level.  This toolkit is still being constructed;
          a preliminary version is expected to be available sometime during
          May 1995.
