Othello - CMPSCI 591E/691E


There is software
    that facilitates writing an Othello player program that can compete with other player
    programs over the internet.  The distribution includes a starter program that plays
    a legal but otherwise random game.
For those using the EdLab machines, the software is already installed on
    /users/users2/cs691e/cs691e.
Current player program addresses are available.
    Put these in .othellorc on your home directory.
Current standings are available.
