Work Sample


 PVM C++ Project 
 Purpose: to implement matrix algebra for parallel computing
 as made possible by pvm ( ...parallel virtual machine ... )




 Classes
 Responsibilities
 Declarations
 Implementations

 Mtx
 Defines a matrix and provides
 basic sequential operations
 Mtx.h 
 Mtx.C 

 MtxIt
 An Iterator for a defined matrix:
 provides various traversals
 MtxIt.h 
 MtxIt.C 

 MtxSg
 Defines a segment of a matrix
 such that matrix operations are possible
 with other segments or matrices and an
 easy update of the original can occur
 MtxSg.h 
 MtxSg.C 

 pvmMtx
 Defines a parallel matrix in the
 master process and coordinates 
 computation in the slave processes
 pvmMtx.h 
 pvmMtx.C 

 pvmMtxP
 Represents the master process
 in the slave processes
 pvmMtxP.h 
 pvmMtxP.C 

 pvmMtxD
 Represents a single slave process
 in the master process
 pvmMtxD.h 
 pvmMtxD.C 

 pvmMtxG
 Represents all slave processes
 as a group in the master process
 pvmMtxG.h 
 pvmMtxG.C 

 mtxdCMO
 Defines command objects passed
 from the master process to the slaves
 mtxdCMO.h 
 mtxdCMO.C 

 mtxdUDO
 Defines an update object
 (...a partial solution ...)
 which is passed from the slaves 
 to the master process for integration
 mtxdUDO.h 
 mtxdUDO.C 

 mtxdEng
 Represents the computational
 engine in the slave processes
 mtxdEng.h 
 mtxdEng.C
