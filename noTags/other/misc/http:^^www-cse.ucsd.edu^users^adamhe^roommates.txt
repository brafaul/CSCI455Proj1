Adam Edlavitch's Roommates Page


  Pictures of my current roommates  


I can't wait until psychologists get the hold of our web pages and
try to learn about us. If you want to be an amateur psychoanalyst,
then you can learn more about my roommates by visiting their own
web pages. Hey, they might even have a description of themselves to
make it a little easier!



 
Thats 
 Ted Carson
with an ex-love Maya. Ted has to be the "cool" guy of our
apartment. Currently working in AI with Dr. Elkan and Dr. Impagliazno.


 
Here is 
 Adam Taylor
. Yep, Taylor seems to approve that we are hanging
Zia's bike off our balcony (Zia did eventually find it). Taylor is
working in the Visual Computing Lab somwhere. He is the extremist in our
apartment. When he parties he  PARTIES  and when he isn't
partying he is trying to make some kind of work record for his lab.



So, where is the picture? I can't find one. I mean, I can't find one
anywhere. In rolls of film taken of us there doesn't seem to be one of
 Kang Su Gatlin
. I think he might be a spy (No, not really. So you in the
"proctective agencies" just move on to another page). Well, we do know
he does some work in the High Performance Computation Lab. Of course, it
could just be a front...



 Take me back (icon forthcoming)
