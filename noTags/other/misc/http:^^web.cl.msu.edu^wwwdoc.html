The World-Wide Web
The World-Wide Web provides a global collection of documents on a wide

operates over the Internet.  WWW originated at the European Particle
Physics Laboratory, CERN.  A "client" program such as Mosaic or Netscape
provides a rich graphical interface.  Another tool, Lynx, provides text-only
access to WWW for dial-up or Telnet users.  Choose from the following
