Introduction
As part of an on-going effort to provide high-performance
interactive visualization, the Theory Center has constructed a
room-sized virtual reality facility. Although the use of virtual reality
in scientific research is still in its infancy, a wide variety of 
scientific disciplines are beginning to take advantage
of the technology. This document lists current VR applications,
gives instructions for using our facility and notes on effective use.
