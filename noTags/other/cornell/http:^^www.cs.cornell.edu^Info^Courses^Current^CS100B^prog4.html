CS100B Program 4 Solution


CS100B Program 4
Solution


I decided to implement my bigint as


#define DIGITS 512

typedef struct {
   unsigned short array[DIGITS];
   int digits;
   } bigint;


I will keep the least significant digit in index 0, and the most significant
digit in (digits-1).


The implementation of my bigint library.


The Sterling's approximation code. Many programs I saw
used two loops to determine n!. This was very inefficient; you only need one
loop.
