Normals



Computing the normal to a surface

There are several ways of computing a normal to a surface. 


If the surface
is defined as a list of triangles then one way of computing the normal
is to compute the normalized cross-product of two edges of the triangle.
Three vertices of a triangle are shown below as P1, P2 and P3.



If we denote 

 then the normal is 
given by



If the surface is defined as a list of general polygons then the Newell
method is a good way to calculate the normal. It produces an "average"
normal if the polygon is not quite planar. It also is not confused by
co-linear vertices.
Calculate the following, where m is the number of vertices in the
polygon.
The normal is then norm([nx, ny, nz]).



If the surface is defined as a parametric equation then differential 
methods may be used to derive the normal.
If the equation for a parametric surface is 



where  0<u<1 and 0<v<1 are two parameters, then the surface normal
is given by
