CoNote - small group annotation experiment



CoNote (Annotation) homepage

The annotation system is an experiment in how people can collaborate
when working with a set of shared documents.  It allows a group of
people to share a set of documents and to make comments about the
documents which are shared with the other members of the group.  An
annotation to a document is a comment on or question about the
document.  Annotations can also refer to other annotations. For
example, they can answer questions or refute arguments.

 An example
 An example of CoNote taken from a problem set from
the Fall 1994 course CS212.  You can't add notes here, but you
can see a realistic example.  Note that this example is taken from the middle of a problem set, so you won't see the context that the students did see.  The names have been changed to protect privacy.

 Obtaining the code
 I plan to release the code, but there are restrictions you must agree to.



The first test of annotations is for Cornell's 
CS212 course to support annotated course notes and problem sets.
We now have a few measurements of
usage.


Help wanted

I would also like to have someone re-implement it to be faster.
