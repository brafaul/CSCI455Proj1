 Phong Lighting
 Introduction. 
In this exercise you will code the lighting equation as a
series of compute statements.
You will bypass the default illumination model which is built into
the Image module. By doing this, you will be able to control lighting
effects directly. For example, you will be able to define a spotlight
or make the intensity of an object drop off with distance.
Procedure:


First you need to download several example files. To do 
this, click on each of the filenames shown
below. When the text window opens, use the "save as" 
option to put the file in your own directory. Name
each file with the same name as shown below. 

  LightTemplate.net 
  LightTemplate.cfg 



The program LightTemplate.net implements a spotlight entirely within
DX using compute modules. Ambient, diffuse and specular terms are
each computed and added together to obtain the intensity of each point. 
Follow the flow of the program to see how the intensities are computed.
For the initial program it is assumed that the light is at a finite
distance from the objects, but the viewer is very far away in a direction
V.

Some examples of the program's output are shown below. The first shows
a spotlight oriented along the y-axis with a "width" of 3.0. 
(A width of 3.0 means (D dot L)^3.0.)
The
small white dot is an icon showing where the light is. The arrow is
an icon showing the direction of the spotlight.



The next image is the same light position, but with the spotlight
width=0.0 so that the light is omnidirectional.
The bright spots on the surfaces near the light are due to a large
(L dot N)  in the diffuse term.        
Notice that the diffuse reflection has the color of the surface,
while the specular reflection has the color of the light (white).



You can turn off the default shading in DX by collecting a single
AmbientLight with the object you are rendering. An AmbientLight ingores
normal information. All you see is the color defined for the object as if
it were lighted from all directions uniformly. The example program
 constructs a surface, calculates the surface normals,
then throws away the lighting information to produce an unshaded surface
(because there is an AmbientLight module). 
The colors you calculate become the color of the objects in the image module.
Note that you must use the Camera/Display module to show the image because
the view-vector, V, must be available to the program. Do not use an Image
module.Throughout this exercise, leave the viewing distance at infinity,
that is, leave the Camera module perspective flag at 0.


Modify the program to use the (N dot H) 
formulation of specular lighting
rather than (R dot V). Make an interactor to choose which model you
are using.

 All surfaces get more shiny at high angle of incidence.
Modify the specular term to simulate this effect.
Below is an example of what the modified program might generate.
The specular reflection on the vertical plane is releatively diffuse
because the angle of incidence is near zero.
The specular reflection from the horizontal plane is narrow because
the angle of incidence is high (the light is grazing the surface).
Clarification:
You need to make some part of the specular term dependent on 
the angle of incidence, arccos(L dot N). The light shown is a
omnidirectional light.
The definition of the reflection vector, R, is given on page 19
of Watt.



The spotlight as given to you has a "soft" cutoff with angle. Modify
the program so that instead of dropping off as a power of a cosine, the
intensity is uniform for angles less than a certain value and zero for
angles more than that value. (Angle is measured here from the D vector.)
Include an interactor to choose between the cutoff methods.
The two images below show a "soft" cutoff spotlight and a "hard" cutoff
spotlight. Note the jagginess at the edge of the hard cutoff light
which results from a very abrupt cutoff function.
Try to minimize the jagginess in your program.




 Modify the program to fly the light through a scene consisting of
a few objects.
The light should be a spotlight which flys a curved path, with the
direction of the spotlight tangent to the path for about half the
flight, then the spotlight should suddenly lock onto one object
and remain locked for the second half of the flight.
One frame of a possible animation is shown below.




 Bugs as of 4/11/95


The term "Ip" in the calculation of the specular term should be moved to
the final calculation so that Ks*Ip*(R dot V)^n is calculated.
 The Compute module does not understand transform objects, so don't use
Rotate, Scale, Translate, or Transform modules when you are building
your scene.

  Questions/Writeup:

Be prepared to demo all of the functions 
specified in the first three bullets above:
ambient lighting, diffuse
lighting, light position, light directionality, and specular reflections of
two kinds in one program. All interactors should
be labeled, have appropriate ranges and step sizes and be in no more than
two control panels. The code should be well documented and organized.

Be prepared to demo the flying light in a separate program.


 What seem to be the differences between the (R dot V) and (N dot H)
specular lighting models in terms of the appearance of objects.

 Write the formula you used to make a surface more shiny at high angles.

 Write the formula you used to impelment a sharp cutoff spotlight.
