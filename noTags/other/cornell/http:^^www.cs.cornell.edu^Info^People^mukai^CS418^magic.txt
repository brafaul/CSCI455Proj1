 animation 

 1. Story 
This animation tells a magic story, where a funny man appears. 
He gets on an airplane and takes off. During the flight, he flies 
over a mountainous area and drops a ball into a body of water, 
which causes a wave.
Then, he flies near a clock tower and his airplane explodes.
However, when we look at the clock tower, the clock disk opens 
and he appears inside of the clock tower.

2. Technique 
a. Physics-based Animation
The ball falling and water wave are animated using physical 
description. Euler integrator is used for the falling ball
and Verlet integrator is used for the water wave.
b. Scientific Visualization
The mountain and cloud are made by random function and
the color of the mountain is mapped according to the height.
The river color is mapped according to the magnitude of the
gradient and trees are made by cones.
c. Texture Mapping
The title flag is made by texture mapping. A two dimensional 
image is used and changed to simulate the waving flag.
d. Volume Texture Mapping
The two tone color of the airplane is made by volume texture 
mapping.
e. Bump Mapping
In order to simulate a real lawn, bump mapping is used.
The normals of the lawn is changed a little bit by random
function.
f. Image Techniques
In the second scene, the first scene image fades out and
the second scene image fades in gradually.
g. Fire work
In order to simulate the bomb explosion, bomb size and color
are changed as time passes.
