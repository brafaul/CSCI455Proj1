 Cornell CS GNU page 






The CS GNU project was started up to have a systematic setup for easy
access to "free" software packages to the department computing
community. Many of these packages are replacements for vendor-supplied
packages and have the advantage of more features and portability on a
variety of platforms. The project is headed by a GNU czar who is
responsible for the installation, maintenance and support of these
packages. There have been two gnu czars so far - Cliff Krumiveda and
 
myself(June 93-present).

 This page links to 
 
software packages  released
under the 
 
GNU general public license 
installed at the Computer Science department. These packages are
currently supported for the HPUX (9.x) and Solaris(2.x) operating
systems. Previous versions of many of these packages also exist for
the SunOS(4.x) operating system, but those versions are not being
upgraded any more.  Cygnus 
provides commerial versions for many of these packages as well as
support and consultancy.  

If you would like to request a package that is not currently
installed, fill out the request form. You can also send bug reports.

 You may find these  maintenance
scripts  helpful if you are starting up your own GNU setup. You
can also find package specific  installation
procedures.
