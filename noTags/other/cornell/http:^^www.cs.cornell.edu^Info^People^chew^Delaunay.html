  Voronoi/Delaunay Applet  

  Voronoi Diagram  / 
Delaunay Triangulation  


If you were running a Java-compatible Web browser, such
as Netscape 2, then you would see a Voronoi Diagram /
Delaunay Triangulation here.  



  The mouse:  Click the mouse in the drawing region to add
new sites to the Voronoi diagram or Delaunay triangulation.

  The Voronoi Diagram and Delaunay Triangulation checkboxes:
 These toggle between the Voronoi diagram and the Delaunay
triangulation.  Your current set of sites remains the same for both
diagrams.

  The Clear button:  Press this to begin a new diagram with
no sites.

  The Show Empty Circles button:  Press this to see the
empty circles for your set of sites.  Each Voronoi vertex (or Delaunay
triangle) has a corresponding empty circumcircle.


 What is it? 
 The  Voronoi diagram  has the property that for each site
(clicked with the mouse) every point in the region around that site is
closer to that site than to any of the other sites.

 The  Delaunay triangulation  is the geometric dual of the
Voronoi diagram.  Alternately, it can be defined as a triangulation of
the sites with the additional property that for each triangle of the
triangulation, the circumcircle of that triangle is empty of all other
sites.

 These closely related data structures have been found to be among
the most useful data structures of the field of Computational Geometry.

 Additional Information 
 The actual data structure here is a Delaunay triangulation.  The
Voronoi diagram is built on-the-fly from the Delaunay triangulation.

 The Delaunay triangulation is built within a large triangle whose
vertices are well off-screen.  That's why in the Delaunay
triangulation there are lines heading off to the upper left, the upper
right, and down.  This technique makes the code simpler, since
otherwise additional code would be needed to handle new sites that are
outside the convex hull of the previous sites.

  The algorithm:  To insert a new site, we walk across the
triangulation, starting from the most recently created triangle, until
we find the triangle that contains the new site.  This triangle and
any adjacent triangles that contain this new site in their
circumcircle are eliminated and the resulting empty spot is
retriangulated.  This site-insertion technique is commonly called the
Bowyer-Watson Algorithm.  The expected time to insert a new site is
roughly O(n1/2) where n is the current number of sites.
