 CS100 Program 5 


 CS100 Program 5 
 Due:  Tuesday, April 16, 1996. 
 Program 5 Notes 

Program 5 ("Genetics") includes a custom Macintosh user interface.
The extra files handed out with the project are part of this
interface.  You need not look at these files; the files you are most
likely to be interested in are: Genetics.h and Graphics.h.  You may
also want to look at the definition of the FacingRC
function in Graphics.cp. 

The code you are to write should go into Genetics.cp (the file
containing the main program). 

Note that the printf function is not available in this
assignment.  Since we are using the custom user interface window,
there is no console for output. 
IMPORTANT:  Since this program uses a
custom Macintosh interface, the project folders may become large when
you compile the code.  Try to use a high density (HD) disk with nothing
else on it when you work on the program. 
NOTE:  If you retrieved the project
files before April 8, the Genes dialog box may not work as expected:
you will have to use the Tab key to move between fields in the dialog
box when you type in the numbers, or the wrong numbers will be placed
in the genes array (in the GetGenes(genes) call).  The
problem has been corrected, if you want to retrieve the project files
again; but using the Tab key will work properly. 
 Corrections to Program 5 Handout 

 (page 3) the constant kGridColumnsPlus2 should be
kGridColsPlus2. 
 (page 3) typedef int PopulationType[kNumKinds][Organisms]
 should be typedef int
PopulationType[kNumKindsOrganisms]. 
 (page 3) kMaxUears should be kMaxYears
. 
 (page 5) in the first paragraph, kGridRowsPlus2
should be kGridRowsPlus2 - 1; same correction for
kGridColsPlus2.




Click  only one  of these links to retrieve the Program 5
folder: 

If you will be working on Program 5 in the public labs, get the

Program 5 Folder. 

If you will be working on your own Mac, get the

Program 5 (At Home) Folder.  This folder contains an extra
library which we have already installed in the labs, but which you
will need at home.
