Parallel Ray Tracing in CC++ 


Vineet Ahuja 


Amith Yamasani 







We propose to parallelize an existing implementation of a ray tracer called
 Raylab, which is a public domain software. 

This sample scene (640x480, reduced here) took approximately 11 minutes to
 render on the sequential version.




We have finished learning CC++ and now intend to investigate strategies for
 parallelization of the code. We will then convert the program first to C++
 (program is currently in C) and then to CC++.
We hope to come close to a speed-up of N. The program will be implemented
 on the SP-2 port of CC++.
