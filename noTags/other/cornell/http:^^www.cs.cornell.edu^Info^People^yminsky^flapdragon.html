Flapdragon: House of Squiddle


  Coop Flapdragon:  
  House of Squiddle 

"Locking you out since 1995."

 An opening in Flapdragon! 

There is an opening starting 12/15 at Flapdragon!  If you'd like to
find out more, call 273-1645 and ask for Kerrin or any of the other
denizens.



 Flapdragon Quote of the Indeterminate Time Period  
(in honor of the election...)

 "Zab wouldn't mind eating Bob Dole."	

                 -Ravitte, referring to the fact that Zab 
                  is neither vegetarian nor Republican.




 Flapdragon is now in its second year, and going strong, with an all new
set of members.  I (who no longer live in Flap but still handle the
homepage) still haven't gotten around to updating the webpage, but I will get
the new member list and the new quote list up in the next week or so.  And
somebody's got to take some new pictures....

 Some basic information:  We're located at 331 W. Seneca, Ithaca
NY, 14850, and our phone number is (607) 273-1645.  Click 
 here 
for definitions of squiddle and flapdragon.

Take a look at the, ahem, somewhat edited, and newly extended
Flapdragon Quote List.

And no flapdragon page would be complete without a picture of us playing
flapdragon.
