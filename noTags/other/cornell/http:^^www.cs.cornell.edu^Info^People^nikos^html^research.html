I work with 
Charles Van Loan. My thesis deals with the 
Kronecker product of matrices. More specifically I am looking at


 Approximating a matrix with the Kronecker product of a pair
of matrices.  
 Expressing FFT and Wavelet algorithms using the
Kronecker product notation.  
 Automatically implementing signal
processing algorithms that use the Kronecker product, via symbolic
manipulation and program transformations. 


I plan on providing access to my system that generates efficient FFT
code for different languages and systems via the WWW. 
For the moment, *only* the input form is working and no code is generated.
Please have a look.



In general, I am interested in numerical linear algebra and parallelization;
use of symbolic math and compiler techniques for optimization; 
FFTs; wavelets; simulation; high performance and scientific computing.
