  Brief Description of Nuprl
 	Nuprl/WWW Browser Design

 System Requirements 
To use the Nuprl/WWW Browser, you should have a World Wide Web client (HTML
browser) that can display inlined GIF and XBM format images and supports
HTML Fill-Out Forms.  NCSA Mosaic for X-Windows is one such client.
Most items will still be readable without image and Fill-Out Form support.
One exception: the     Nuprl Theory/Theorem Browser
will be will be unreadable without XBM image support.
