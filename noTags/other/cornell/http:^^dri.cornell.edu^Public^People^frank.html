 Frank's Web Playground 


 The New and Improved Frank's Happy, Fun Page 
  Presents  
 Answers to All Your Questions 
 of course it goes without saying that this page is in a 
non-stable state and that it'll take a little time for
the fun bits to work their way into these pages...


 Well, my old and bitter Happy, Fun Page at Ohio State's CIS
Department is finally gone.  C'est la guerre.

 And now some answers to all your questions... 

 Who is he? 
 Why is he here? 
 What does he do? 
 Where can he be found? 
 How about showing his .plan? 
(and research interests).
 
What form of madness is this? 
 
Does he have a home page at the CS dept? 
 
How come there isn't anything fun on this page??? 
 
What'll I do if the answer to one of my questions isn't here? 
 What sort of flying have you done?
