If you're interested in the inner workings of the Dylan interpreter, 

download a "mini" version written by Justin 
Voskuhl.  It's written in Pascal, so you can look at the source code.
It can display the substitution model eval/apply steps for the
expressions it evaluates as well, which may be useful to some
students for prelim 1.
