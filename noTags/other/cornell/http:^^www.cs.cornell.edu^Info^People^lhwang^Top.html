Overview

Since mid-80's the internet has been growing fastly at a exponential rate with different sizes and types of networks connected together for data communications. As the networks become larger and more complex, a high quality networking monitoring system with network status control, faults detection and performance analises becomes a vital necessity for any distributed computing environment. Problems occurred in the network can be easily reflected and solved in a very short time. Our goal is to design and implement an efficient network management system with different networks topologies discoveries and display it through a graphical interface to give a clear view of the connections and status. Faults detection and performace analises are also incorporated in the project.   


Technical Backgrounds

 Simple Network Management Protocols(SNMP) : SNMP is developed in mid-80's in orderto provided a simple and efficient protocol for network management data communications between different types of networks. It is easy to implement on a large network system without posing too much stress on the network.Also,it is being supported by most of the internetwork architetures(routers and bridges). The exchange of information using SNMP is made through messages(PDU) which can be viewed as objects that contain both values and titles from a higher perspective. There are only five types of PDUs used by SNMP to monitor the network: two for terminal data settings, two for terminal data reading and one for monitoring events such as start-up and shut-downs.


Project Success Criteria
1. A deliverable software with a GUI that displays different topologies and 
      network status. Manager interactions with the network.


2. The basic management specifications such as fault detection and topologies display and performanace analises achieved.


3. Successfu testing in a simulated local area network.


Expected Educational Results

 Understand the use of the most popular networking management communication protocols.
 Learn the different network models and management issues associated to the networks.
 Capability to design management applications according to the specifications and considering some major issues such as security management, configuration management, fault management and accounts management.
 Know  how to manage a network system.
