CS381/481 Fall 96 Study Guide

CS381/481 Fall 1996
Automata and Computability Theory
Final Exam Study Guide



The final exam will be 2.5 hours, open book and notes.  All questions
are roughly equal weight.

 The exam will be comprehensive, covering all material we have
covered in the course, including material tested on the two prelim
exams.  Roughly equal weight will be devoted to each of the three
parts of the course.

 I will ask you to do one formal proof, and it will probably be an
undecidability proof.  There may also be an essay question.

 The primary source is the online lecture notes.  Suggested
supplementary readings are taken from the text by J. E. Hopcroft and
J. D. Ullman, Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and
Computation, Addison-Wesley, 1979; the appropriate sections are
indicated beside each topic.

 In addition to these specific topics, you will need to have a good
general understanding of what it means for a set to be regular,
context-free, recursive, and r.e.; of the capabilities of finite
automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines; and of how to
describe sets using regular expressions and context-free grammars.
