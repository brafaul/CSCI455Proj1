Abstract:
A distributed multi-media application involves more than just protocols for
the dissemination of video and audio data.
As in any other distributed application, protocols are necessary that
guarantee the consistency, fault-tolerance, and security of shared data
objects.
The Horus system offers a framework for building complex distributed systems
that involve any number of protocols, as well as a variety of protocols for
the different aspects of a distributed application (including some
protocols specific to multi-media applications).
We believe that this integrated approach is superior to combining different
toolkits, and illustrate this with a detailed example of an existing
video-on-demand application.
