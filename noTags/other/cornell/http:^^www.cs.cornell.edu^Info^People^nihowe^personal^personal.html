 The Brief Story Of My Life: 
I was born in Port Jefferson, Long Island on December 30, 1970 (or so I am told.)  When I was three years old, my family moved to Hamden, Connecticut, where I grew up.  I went to college at Princeton University where I majored in physics.  Graduating in 1993, I joined the Teach for America program and spent two years teaching at a small rural public high school in Arkansas.  I am now in my second year of the computer science PhD program at Cornell.

 Links to my Princeton past: 
At Princeton, I was a member of the Princeton Mime Company.  I am a former director of PrinceCon, a production of the Simulation Games Union.  Although I try to deny it, I was occasionally seen with that orange-and-black-plaid monstrosity, the Band.  I also had lots of friends in the Wildcats, a cool a capella group.

 Other Web sites I found interesting: 
Fantasy Pictures - just what it says.
Tarot - well, the graphics look neat, anyway.
Meyers-Briggs Personality Test - I'm an INTJ.  What's your sign?
Earthwatch - looking for a different sort of vacation?
SPAM Haikus, etc. - just what you've been looking for!
Funny Pages - lots more jokes.
The Zipper - find out how to bug your representative in Congress.
Voters Telecom Watch - Internet anti-censorship group.
Inktomi - a fast search engine.  Named after a Native American myth.
