Contact Improvisation


Contact Improvisation
What is Contact Improvisation?

I've never seen a definition of Contact that I really liked.  For some
people, it's a (new) folk dance.  For others, it's a process for
finding new choreographic ideas.  Some people perform it, others do it
as a practise or discipline.  Some people look at it and see
gymnastics, or wrestling, or swing dance.  What are the "mere facts"
about it?  It's usually done as a duet (but sometimes solo or in
larger groups), it's usually in silence; and it's improvised. Dancers
are as likely to be on the floor as standing, and sometimes they're
flying on someone else's shoulders.  Now I have a couple of
photographs (but I could still use some more, and, someday, video.)

The single best place to find out more, short of just doing it, is
in the pages of Contact Quarterly, a magazine that
covers contact and the extended family of new dance.

What's this page for?
 My intention is to use it as a referral service for jams,
workshops, classes and events.  I don't see a need for an online
magazine or journal for Contact, since we're already well served by
the Quarterly.  On the other hand I'd like to have a couple of
photographs, and maybe even a video clip. In a couple of years, when
there's more bandwidth available on the net, we can try setting up
live connections between jams.
This page is maintained by Jim Davis, email to jdavis@parc.xerox.com.  I
really appreciate getting mail already in HTML, especially if your information is lengthy.
