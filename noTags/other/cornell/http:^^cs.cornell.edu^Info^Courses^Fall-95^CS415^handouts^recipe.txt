Penne ai broccoli
 PENNE AI BROCCOLI: pasta; sauce; pecorino cheese.

 Add the sauce to the pasta.
 Grate fresh pecorino cheese (not the pre-grated stuff!) on top of
it.
 Buon appetito!


 PASTA: water; salt; penne; broccoli.

 Bring water to boil; add salt, broccoli florets, and penne.
 Stir well. Drain when  al dente (about 10 minutes, if you
bought a good brand of pasta).

 SAUCE: extra-vergin olive oil; garlic; chili peppers.

 In extra vergin olive oil, brown 3 or 4 cloves of garlic and a
couple of chili peppers.
 Remove cloves and peppers before serving.
