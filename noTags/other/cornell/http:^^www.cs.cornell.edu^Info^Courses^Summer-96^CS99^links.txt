LINKS













None of these links are guaranteed to
still exist, but, hey, nothing works
all the time in the REAL world.  Just
bug Jon about it.

As a starter, you might want to try 
all these links about the Web and 
how to write HTML pages.  If you 
want to put your own home page up,
just ask me, or mail me
your HTML page, 
and I'll post it.
