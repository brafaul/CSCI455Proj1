Software for Scientific Computing 

 Software for Scientific Computing 

The development of new software and the evaluation of existing
software for scientific computing are important to the future of
science and high performance computing.  Many existing groups and
projects at the CTC already involve aspects of such work; among these
are  CSERG ,  ACRI , the  DX repository , the  Software Support
Group , and the Parallel Tools team.  The purpose of this page is
to provide a repository for information on other such activities and
materials of interest.  For the moment, Chris Myers and Anne Trefethen
have created and contributed to this page, but other people and
activities are certainly welcome.  So please contact either Chris or
Anne if you're working on something that should be included here.



 Numerical libraries, class libraries and frameworks 

Chris and Anne are interested in the use and
development of reusable software in the form of numerical libraries,
object-oriented class libraries and code frameworks
(a.k.a. "templates" or "archetypes").  Listed below are some packages
of interest (either publicly installed on CTC machines, under
development or evaluation on CTC machines, or "out there").

distributed grids, from UC-San Diego
