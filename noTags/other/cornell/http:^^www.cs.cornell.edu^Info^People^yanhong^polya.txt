Polya Related Project: Composing Efficient Programs


Composing Efficient Programs

Optimization and selection techniques for building effcient programs
from components.

Theme

It is a trend that software be composed from existing components,
forming even larger components.  One of the most challenging issues is
the efficiency of the resulting programs, which depends largely on
optimization across component interfaces and selection of appropriate
components given complicated interactions among them.  How to perform
such optimization and selection systematically is one of my particular
interests.
