Upson's Familiar Quotations (Third Edition) 1974 - 1985
Al Gaulle, Editor
September 1982
Cornell Computer Science Department

This report is a compilation of several hundred examples of
context-free language and very irregular expressions.
Contributions were submitted over the past several years
by numerous computer science graduate students who collected
these now immortal words in classes and seminars.  We wish
to express our gratitude to the faculty, guest lecturers,
and students who provided the bulk of this work.

Greg Andrews
75 Sep 03:
(On the banker's algorithm:)
There are parallel paths of confusion through it.
75 Oct 03:
In six months people figure out how to use their machines until
they're overused.  That's called ``enhancement.''
75 Oct 08:
(On the 613 project:)  We've tried to make it as painless as
possible, but it will be painful.
75 Oct 20:
(On the midterm:)  All I know is it's a 50 point exam, and McGraw
got a 35 and beat me by 5 points.
75 Oct 31:
This is a string of stack snack shops -- uhmm -- snap shots.
75 Nov 03:
If the last page of the priority list is three, we take the threeth page.
75 Nov 03:
Let's just throw up a few distinct partitions of memory.
75 Nov 07:
(On queuing models:)  I'm not going to go through all that crud
-- I don't understand it anyway.
75 Dec 05:
Everything has to be written down and not in my head, because
I don't know my head from a hole in the wall.
76 Sep 20:
There are two ways to share data.  The first is that you don't.
You either share it or you don't, if you know what I mean.  No, you don't.
76 Nov 17:
There's nothing profound here, and that may be true of the whole lecture.
76 Nov 19:
This is important, but the stuff I understand is completely irrelevant.
77 Sep 05:
\&... then there are idiots like myself who try to hang on.
77 Sep 23:
The Dining Philosophers is an interesting problem posed by
Dijkstra.  Many interesting problems with no practical application
were posed by Dijkstra.
77 Sep 30:
I'll show you some syntax and you'll go ``yuck'' -- and
that's the state of the art.
78 Sep 28:
It would sure be nice to not need another mechanism for every problem.
78 Sep 28:
This room is a monitor.  One person is active and everybody else is asleep.
78 Oct 20:
I had a nice clean solution in my paper until the referee
told me it wasn't legal.
78 Oct 25:
Gries, you're a sweet rat.
78 Nov 01:
Student: Excuse me, I've been a little confused lately.

Andrews: Like about 23 years?
78 Dec 01:
There's no way I can hope to get done today, so I suspect
I'll dribble over to Monday.
78 Dec 06:
It's amazing how much you can do lecturing, when you realize how
little there is.
78 Dec 08:
There's a mistake in the notes from the last lecture -- all but
the following line is incorrect.
Becky Bennett
81 Sep 09:
The computer is getting constipated.
Corky Cartwright
76 Sep 22:
This is ambiguous, but I'll try to resolve the ambiguity with more prose.
77 May 04:
I sort of have the minimal knowledge of hardware you can
have and come out of Stanford.
77 Sep 13:
I shouldn't even mention keypunches in connection with LISP.  That's heresy.
77 Sep 15:
Can you put my obfuscation into words?
77 Sep 20:
I claim that every other possibility is impossible.
77 Oct 11:
Is that a question?  I keep hearing these grunts.
77 Oct 13:
Let's get on quickly to the handwaving we can do.
78 Sep 13:
Computer scientists are so accustomed to reality that,
when they are given the opportunity to create an illusion, they won't.
78 Sep 18:
After we solve the reliable software problem, we must solve
the reliable lecture problem.
78 Sep 18:
Programming languages should not be subject to whimsical
variations in semantics that depend on the mood of the person
who wrote the compiler.
78 Sep 21:
Gries: Why don't you just show us the whole slide?

Corky: Can't quarrel with God.
78 Oct 25:
We should come up with programming languages that don't require
a telephone book to describe their little pathologies.
78 Nov 06:
Outside this expression language, APL sucks.
78 Nov 22:
A program is a comment, a means for getting from a precondition
to what you want.
79 Oct 24:
(On SNOBOL:) I'm just someone that looks on from the outside and grimaces.
79 Oct 29:
It's hard to say what an elegant SNOBOL program is.
79 Oct 29:
This is a real whiz bang program.
79 Oct 29:
I would consider that obscene programming, even in SNOBOL.
79 Nov 12:
Sound like NA?  Let's get away from it and go on to another topic.
Bob Constable
75 Oct 15:
If you read the proof in Hopcroft and Ullman, and you'll need to
read it after this ...
77 Jan 26:
The only way false can be true is if ...
77 Mar 28:
Let me change the theorem to one I can actually prove.
78 Feb 17:
Now we only have ten minutes left for hard science.
But that's probably enough ...
78 Feb 22:
\&... a really kinky semantics that would support the slickest proof rules ...
78 Mar 27:
Student: Number 6 doesn't make sense to me.

Constable: Well, let's write it out bigger.
78 Mar 31:
What's going to be amazing is that next time I'll be able to
prove -- that itself will be amazing -- ...
78 Apr 23:
Let me back up to where I believed it.
78 Apr 25:
This syntactic sugar is looking terrible -- syntactic pepper.
78 May 11:
Stanford gobbled up the really good women.
79 Feb 09:
We are experimenting with constructive set theory, and so may go wrong.
79 Feb 23:
One reason that concept is peculiar is that in mathematics one always
deals with extensional objects, and thus never discusses them,
while in computer science one rarely deals with extensional
objects, and thus never discusses them.
80 Jan 28:
This wealth of knowledge will get us confused.
80 Jan 30:
We want to lift ourselves out of the primitive recursive muck.
80 Feb 08:
(On the Axiom of Choice in constructive mathematics:)
It has the same status as in classical math. You can worry about it.
80 Feb 08:
Truth and computation are identical.
80 Feb 13:
I don't think I've ever written a RAM program.
80 Feb 18:
Sometimes the empty set causes me pause.
80 Feb 27:
``To be or not to be'' is not an algorithm.
80 Apr 07:
Nothing makes sense in the last five minutes.
80 Apr 16:
Let's do a pictorial proof again.
80 Oct 13:
We are able to remove logic completely.
80 Nov 04:
Student: I've never seen a computer that implements the integers.

Constable: Unfortunately, they're not building them the way they ought to.
81 May 15:
Well, it looks like today's lecture
is going to be more confused than normal.
Dick Conway
75 Feb 10:
PL/19 might have this form, Dijkstra be damned,...
75 Sep 02:
This is unreasonable, but I've
been doing it that way for a long time.
75 Sep 23:
(On relational data bases:)  I don't know anything about
the mathematical basis of it, but I've read it so many times
I think I can reproduce it verbatim.
75 Oct 16:
(On JCL:)  I've always been able to find some grad student
who has been able to understand all this, and I've never
had to learn any of it.
75 Oct 21:
This is all done for you by mirrors.  I think it's kind of cute.
75 Oct 28:
RPG is a shame.
76 Oct 07:
For anybody else that'd be silly, but not for Dijkstra.
76 Oct 07:
(To Gries:)  You're cheating, but we still haven't figured out how.
77 Sep 13:
This is instantaneous, which is pretty fast.
80 May 09:
I am not a chronic dumper on IBM, but here they need it three colors.
80 May 12:
I can't quit without telling you about the lunatic fringe of Information
Retrieval.
80 May 12:
I wouldn't want to be quoted, but I can cover all the interesting facts
of 635 in \(12-hour.
80 Sep 23:
Don't be seduced by a lovely query language.
80 Oct 30:
Undo is an abomination.
80 Oct 30:
Try that on your old IMS system.
80 Nov 11:
Ullman describes fourteen of the basic seven.
80 Nov 11:
(On COBOL:) Its procedures are absolutely lousy.
80 Nov 13:
(On IMS:) Protects against small children and honest men.
80 Nov 20:
(On reading chapter 5 of Ullman:) If you're really masochistic, go ahead.
Alan Demers
77 Sep 28:
The key to this is that -- is that -- oh, my ...
78 Feb 14:
It's not as good a semi-colon as PL/I.
78 Mar 07:
Student: Constants do matter in the real world.

Demers: Well, especially since infinity here is 4800.
78 Mar 19:
Jesus H. Bald Christ!
78 Apr 20:
I don't want to sound like I'm avoiding answering your question;
I just want to avoid answering your question.
78 Apr 20:
Jesus!  How do you give a talk like this with Reynolds in the audience?
78 Apr 27:
One reason you might want to say, ``Why not?'', or rather one
reason you might want to say, ``Why?'', or actually, a reason you'd say ``not.''
78 Sep 13:
Let me suppose, and this is a big assumption -- it gets an asterisk --, ...
78 Sep 15:
Student: Isn't that an inspired construction?

Demers: Oh, it is.  When I thought of it I was insufferably
proud of myself for hours.
78 Sep 18:
Let me say what I'm not going to do at the moment.
78 Sep 28:
After looking at that for some time, the i and the i are
not the same i, are they?
78 Sep 29:
Not only is it not obvious, I claim in general it's false.
78 Oct 02:
That's in Knuth, volume tree.
78 Oct 04:
By the way, if all you people understand this proof it will all
but double the number of people in the world that do.
78 Oct 04:
When I do it, it comes out that way.  When Tarjan does it,
it comes out that way.  So proof by intimidation.
78 Oct 16:
Let's take this whole section of the board and write a
big ``dubito'' over it.
78 Oct 16:
The precise definition is motivated by that bow tie.
78 Oct 16:
The reason I can't say that is because it's not true.
78 Nov 06:
I sure wish I had a snappy comeback.
78 Nov 06:
It's a commutative ring, so I can do a whole lot of cavalier things.
78 Nov 08:
It's not in general obvious how to do it, but I was hoping that would slip by.
78 Nov 13:
This may be impossible.  At least it's hard.  I don't know how to do it.
78 Nov 15:
When I divide b by n what do I get?  Well, I get b over n, obviously.
78 Nov 17:
A k-tape non-deterministic Turing machine is this umpteen-tuple.
78 Nov 17:
Demers: Here is the promised Fast Fourier Transform example.
It worked for the two examples I tried, so I'm fairly sure it's correct.

Student: Proof by exhaustive testing?

Demers: Well, it sure exhausted me.
78 Nov 17:
No, I did not prove it correct.
I sat at a terminal at midnight and fiddled with it until it worked.
78 Nov 20:
It depends on something that I really don't want to get into --
it depends on honesty.
78 Nov 20:
It just wouldn't do you any good to apply the pumping lemma to the
168 -- it doesn't stay up that long.
78 Dec 01:
It spaces me out every time I look at it.
78 Dec 06:
I can write the expression down in polynomial space and time --
in fact, I'm going to write it down in about three seconds on the board here.
79 Feb 22:
You put handcuffs on yourself and try to swim the English Channel or something.
79 Mar 27:
Demers: Why did we switch from call-by-reference to call-by-value,
when we switched from procedures to functions?

Donahue: I don't know.

Demers: I guess that's as good an answer as any.
79 Aug 02:
I don't want to remove temptation from malicious people.
I want them to be malicious and then have the pleasure of killing them.
80 Jan 21:
You don't solve NP-complete problems in your compiler.
80 Jan 23:
I think right linear.
80 Feb 06:
PL/I is a disaster, right?
80 Feb 20:
The Algol-68 phenomemon is a little bizarre.
80 Apr 02:
(After Bowen's annual spring haircut:) That is really far out.
I don't know if I should deliver a eulogy.
80 Apr 09:
(After using both `adr' and `addr' to abbreviate `address':)
``d''s are idempotent.
80 Apr 16:
People who generate self-modifying code are in a state of mortal sin.
80 Aug 06:
In the back of my mind is an LSI-11.
80 Nov 17:
You can't lose tenure. You can't get it either.
80 Nov 24:
Bliss is frightening.
81 Sep 25:
``I'm not married but I have a medical excuse.''
81 Oct 14:
Gee, bottoms are getting bigger and bigger...
82 Jan 30:
I'm explaining this as though it were a well-known technique, but in fact
I just invented it.
82 Feb 03:
It would be a tremendous help if I could talk and write at the same time.
82 Feb 03:
There exists an alpha such that ... God!
82 Feb 03:
We are just about at the end, so I can bullshit now.
82 Feb 15:
I'm not Bob Constable up here, I'm perfectly willing to consider functions
as ordered pairs.
82 Feb 24:
Can I erase this board? Obviously - I've just done it.
82 Mar 03:
Demers: I don't say `gack' in lecture all the time!

Student: Yes you do, and `sigh.'

Demers: Oh, I do?  Sigh...
82 Mar 24:
This language also has garbage commands -- that is guarded commands...Oh no! I 
didn't say that.
John Dennis
74 Mar 27:
Chebyshev, I'm sure, wouldn't do something false.
74 Apr 01:
(On teaching induction to freshmen:)
One year, one of the bachelor professors got a girl
to understand it, and he married her.
74 Apr 03:
(On the Remes algorithm:)  I'm not sure if it's gonna be a math
lecture or a religious experience.
74 Apr 03:
I'm gonna say this -- I hope it's true.
74 Apr 19:
\&... sequences that go off to hell in a wheelbarrow.
74 Apr 29:
If that were clear, then I'd be very offended.
74 May 03:
I guess I'm kind of a numerical analytic Eichmann.
If the guy says ``fit it with a line,'' I'll fit it with a line.
74 Sep 30:
I'm just gonna, as my old Texas analysis teacher used to say,
jump on it and ride it till it falls.
74 Dec 02:
Suppose that God or someone high up in government told me ...
Jim Donahue
77 Feb 02:
The proof took five blackboards, so the method is worthless.
77 Feb 14:
I can fill up blackboards in a great hurry.
If you can fill up blackboards very quickly, then it must be interesting.
77 Feb 16:
Eventually we'll do more than just push bottoms around.
77 Mar 14:
This is sort of denotational bootcamp.
77 Mar 16:
After a while, if your mind gets warped enough, you tend to think
in these terms.
78 Sep 28:
Take a type -- now I'm real dumb in doing this ...
79 Jan 23:
Why are we doing this?  Because there are some neat theorems to
be proved at the end of this course.
79 Jan 25:
You really wouldn't want to work out the successor of 25.
79 Feb 01:
I don't have a copy of this.  I've never even read it, but
it gets referenced a lot.
79 Feb 06:
Why am I using complete lattices?  Well, it's what I was brought up on.
79 Feb 08:
It turns out that restricting yourself to continuous functions is
no great act of heroism.
79 Feb 27:
I'll call this phi and psi again just to be confusing.
79 Feb 27:
You can easily show that any space you can imagine is buried
within D-infinity somewhere.
79 Mar 01:
There are infinitely many bottoms around.
79 Mar 01:
This is probably the most influential paper in semantics that's never
been published.
79 Mar 06:
(On ``Admissibility of Fixed Point Inductions in First Order
Logic of Typed Theories,'' by S. Igarashi:)
This report is about as impenetrable as its title.
79 Mar 13:
By the time you read the details, you should either be completely
lost, or completely understand what is going on.
79 Mar 13:
We haven't said anything and we've said everything.
79 Mar 13:
Well, I'm not going to talk about string quartets today.
79 Mar 27:
He probably wanted to get to the point where he could define PL/I
on one side of a 3x5 card.
79 Apr 17:
I would like to say we've proven such a theorem for Russell, but
Alan's been awfully slow about it.
79 Apr 24:
It's got plus and times and all that other neat stuff.
79 May 03:
If you spend a lot of time building up the mathematics of the
model, by the time you're done, you're tired.
79 Oct 09:
A terminal node is not one that is about to die.
79 Oct 09:
Its predecessor is somewhere off in the great beyond. 
81 Mar 02:
Gads, this is ugly.
Diane Duke
78 Mar 01:
The water's being shut off in an hour, so you'd better go now,
or forever hold your, uh, piece.
78 Dec 13:
We're trying very hard to make sure that this Christmas
tree isn't anti-semantic.
81 May 21:
(Referring to the fact that Becky and Geri had just finished their
exams in CS100 and 101)
All the little testies are now overies.
81 May 21:
Every time Michelle gets drunk I have to wash her pants.
81 May 21:
Michelle, get your hands off me!
81 Aug 23:
Michelle, aren't your pants off yet?
81 Nov 13:
(After reading the review of Yeoman:)  I hope she [the reviewer]
never tries to take any CS courses.
John Gilbert
81 May 21:
Becky: Can you guarantee I'll get a B minus?

Gilbert: What kind of an arrangement did you have in mind?
David Gries
76 Sep 23:
(To Salton:)
Gerry, when was the last time you wrote a program?
76 Sep 30:
Hopefully -- I'm David Gries from Cornell.
76 Oct 07:
Conway: Half a proof might be very long but not very helpful.

Gries: Yes, and a whole proof might be wrong.
77 Mar 31:
Yes.  No.  Not really.  Probably there is, but I'd have to think about it.
77 Nov 03:
Gries: Could you explain where the term ``modal'' comes from?

Constable: No.

Gries: Thank you.
78 Mar 03:
(To first-year students:)  The only reason we're here and you're
there is that we're older than you.
78 Oct 17:
Student: In the recursive Towers of Hanoi program, how do you
prove that you never put a disk on a smaller disk?

Gries: You prove it by recursion.

Student: You prove it by recursion?

Gries: Sure, you just say, ``By recursion.''
79 Mar 26:
Student: Could you lower the blinds, please?

Gries: Are you sure it's not my brilliance that's blinding you?
79 Apr 25:
Gries: ... ``dereferencing'' and ``ref-referencing''? ... ``anti-dereferencing''? ...

Student: How about ``referencing''?

Gries: That's too simple.
79 Sep 06:
(writing on the board) If I can't read it, tell me.
81 Feb 26:
Schneider:  Which DeWitt are we talking about?

Gries:  I thought I was DeWitt around here.

Research Summary 1980-81
.ad

Well, I didn't get much done this year.
I tried, but I wasn't too successful.
Something always kept me from
making the significant, creative advances I wanted to make.
Maybe next year will be better, but this year was a washout.

I don't mean to offer these as excuses, but here are some of the things that
interrupted my thinking and kept all those neat ideas from springing out
of me (I know they're in me, somewhere).
I was in charge of the United Way fund for our department.
Three cases of sexual harassment (going both ways) were handled by me in
my position as graduate field rep.
One student hurt his head and was in the hospital for a week at Christmas time.
Somebody had to look after him, so I visited him and read comics to
him every day.
Because I don't really have any opinions of my own, and can therefore be called
neutral, I was called on to mediate in the usual political fights between
faculty members, which we all know are ruining our department.
The heat didn't work and the bathroom stunk and the traffic bureau wanted to
revoke our VP sticker and a student's dog bit another student and
an M.Eng. student failed the colloquium course and one student ate five
doughnuts before one colloquium and we went 1 student over our quota
and a student's lunch was stolen from the refrigerator.
Each of these called for a careful 2-page letter.
These are only a few of the incidents that I took care of.

I did write and prove correct a 20-line program in January, but I made
the mistake of testing it on our VAX and it had an error, which two
weeks of searching didn't uncover, so there went one publication out the
window.
I guess I could have slipped it into IPL anyway, since I'm an editor for it,
but, since I have tenure already, I didn't feel right in doing that.

I did work on the four-color problem.
The work at Illinois had convinced me that you didn't have to
prove your programs correct to publish in math journals -- the
messier the program, the more likelihood of acceptance.
But, after a week, I had to draw maps with
four colors and the secretaries were out of the non-permanent colored
transparency pens and I lost interest.

Every once in a while I would try to get something done at home, but
that, too, was a bomb.
My Terak would act up, so I couldn't write, and my pen was broken.
I was assistant to the assistant coach in both baseball and soccer
for my son's team (that's the only way we could get him to play regularly),
so I had to spend a lot of time at Cass Park.
Then there was boy scouts and those awful camping trips in the rain, which
would lay me up in bed for weeks at a time with fever and runny nose.
Something always arose to stop me from working at home.
To top it off, one evening two weeks ago, I was working hard at home
trying to be creative so I would have something to say in this damn report,
when a neighbor's dog ate the last of our guinea pigs, and
that began a crisis that lasted for 3 days and ruined the few thoughts
I had.

Well, so much for the research summary.
Maybe next year will be better.

Formalize all the hell out of Mathematics.

I can write quintuples at high speed.
79 Nov 09:
I really can't do it, but I'll do it.

If the polynomial hierarchy collapses, there'll be panic at some

82 Jun 28:
Somebody once asked John Hopcroft about the problem of P and NP. He answered:
``On Tuesdays,
I try to prove that they are equal, on the rest of the week - that
they are different.''
I believe that he has reduced the time to try to show that
they are equal to Sunday afternoons.
82 Jun 28:
I strongly suspect that this set is complete.  I have not written yet a proof
because none occurred to me.  No, the correct statement is: ``I have not written
yet a proof because none occurred to my students.''
John Hopcroft

Everything in this class is a power of two.

Not everything I say is correct.
It's correct modulo the little details you're going to have to worry about.

Does everyone see the intuitive idea before we get into the details?
Does anyone want to see the details?
79 Oct 19:
How about a proof by example?
79 Oct 19:
Now we can prove problems right and left to be NP-complete.

Let me show you how easy it is to show things P-space complete.

I won't give you a sketch of the proof because the sketch wouldn't be sketchy.
78 Oct 06:
The proof of this is so simple that I'm going to give it.
78 Oct 09:
It seems we have transformed a difficult problem into an impossible one.
78 Oct 11:
So zero is strictly less than one.
78 Nov 08:
If we do not know @ f(x) @, its @ (n+1) sup st @ derivative is
even harder to come by.

Usually, of course, you stop after a finite number of steps.

78 Oct 17:
Student: Would you like to help grade the 211 exams?

Salton: No. I probably am not qualified.

In principle, you need to know nothing.
In practice, you need to know something, but not much.

I could say that this is a non-subject, but then you would wonder
