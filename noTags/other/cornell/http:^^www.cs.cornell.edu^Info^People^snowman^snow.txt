oh the weather outside is frightful...


what do you mean, blizzards are bad?

my second favorite kind of weather is a really good winter blizzard.
i've just never been one of those people who get all hot under the
collar when there's tons of snow on the ground.  this may partially be
because i live 2/3 of a mile from my office in upson, but i also just
really like the silence, the softness, and the feeling of snow. 

i also truly believe that there's nothing holier looking than a grove
of old trees with snow covering each branch.  it even makes places
like mit look beautiful.

and as for cornell, suffice to say that much of my unproductive time
last winter was spent playing out in the snow.  i truly wish much more
had been spent that way, rather than in the unpleasant bits, but at
least some was.
