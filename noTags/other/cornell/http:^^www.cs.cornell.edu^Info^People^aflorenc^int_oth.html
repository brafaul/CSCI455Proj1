Other Interests

Dilbert

I am a member of the DNRC. My title is "Minister of Hobgoblins of Little
Minds". This refers to an e-mail I sent Scott Adams about the 4th and 6th
DNRC newsletters. I pointed out a small inconsistency between the newsletters.
Therefore, I am in charge of foolish consistency in the DNRC.

Every day, I read the new Dilbert cartoon on the Dilbert Zone.

Babylon 5

Babylon 5 is a science fiction television show produced by Warner Brothers.
They have an
official web site, though I think the
unofficial
Lurker's Guide is the best source
for episode information.

I am a card-carrying member of the Babylon 5 Fan Club. I was also a winner in
the Babylon 5 Mystery Alien Sweepstakes.
