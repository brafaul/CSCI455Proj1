HANDOUT: Prelim #1 answers


Prelim #1 notes

Review session is Sunday at 3:00
Prelim is Monday 7:30-9:00 PM

Coverage is: everything (but there will be no
detailed questions on the stack model)
Closed book, closed notes, mostly for your benefit.
Bring a writing implement.
We don't stress memorization
We will forgive minor syntactic errors

Room assignments: A-L Upson B17, M-Z Phillips
101
Don't miss the prelim!

Make up exams are oral, and guaranteed to be
no easier than the real one



Compound statements

Another kind of C statement (we've actually seen
this already, but hadn't given it a name)
This is what the curly braces {}
do, at least so far

Sort of like begin and end in PASCAL

Syntax: an open curly brace {,
then 0 or more statements, then a closed curly brace }{x
= 3;y = square(x);}
A compound expression can include declaration
statements, but they must all appear at the beginning (i.e., before
any statement which is not a declaration statement).
Example with declaration:{int
y;y = square(x);}


Scoping rules

Nasty example (don't write code like this)void
main(){int x;x = 3;{int x;x =4;printf("%d",x);}}


The rule is simple: to figure out which x
is intended, look outwards from the line you are on until you
find x.

You can add this to the stack model, but it's
a little ugly and we won't do it
We won't use this feature in anything very complicated
in CS100B



Where have we seen compound statements?

Conditional statements often involve compound
statementsif (test)
thenstatement else elsestatement
test
is an expression, but thenstatement
and elsestatement
can be any statement
It is good practice to use compound statements
with conditional statements - it makes your code much easier to
read
Where else have we seen compound statements?

Hint: in this case, they usually involve declarations



Fun with else

You don't actually need to use else
with ifif
(x != 0) y = 1/x;printf("%d",42);


This can lead to totally unreadable code, especially
if you nest your if
statements. Don't do this!if
(x != 0) if (y != 0) z = x/y;else z = -1;


There is a reasonable way of doing multiway conditional
statementsif (test1)
statement1else if (test2) statement2else if (test3) statement3…else
defaultstatement
I don't personally find this incredibly readable,
but sometimes it's necessary


Iteration

Today we'll mostly cover the syntax of iteration
in C

We'll do some examples of its use in section

Iteration involves executing some part of your
program repeatedly (as does recursion!)
The easiest way to do iteration is with whilewhile
(expression) statement
Typically, statement
is a compound statement
semantics of while:

evaluate expression. 

If it is false (zero), then we're done with the
while statement.
If it is true (non-zero), then evaluate statement,
then evaluate the while statement again




Example

void countdown(int count){
while (count > 0) {printf("%d…",count);
count = count - 1;} printf("Blastoff!");}
void main(){ start = 10; countdown(start); printf("%d",start);}



This example also shows off a subtle but important
property of the stack model
Note that if the test expression is never 0,
your while statement will run forever
How do we get out of a while
statement early?
while (count > 0) {printf("%d…",count);if
(NASA_goofed()) return; count = count - 1;}


Break statements

Suppose that instead of getting out of the entire
countdown function we merely want to get out of the while statement

NASA didn't goof, the astronauts got impatient
and decided to blast off before the countdown finished

There is a good way and a bad way. We're only
going to teach you the good way.
The break
statement terminates a while
statementvoid countdown(int
count){ while (count > 0) {printf("%d…",count);
count = count - 1;if (astronauts_bored(count)) break;} printf("Blastoff!");}


What about nested while statements?

Again, this allows unreadable code to be created

The world has enough of this without you folks
contributing!

Small example:while(x
> 0){ x = x - 1; while (y < 0)
{ if (abs(x-y) < 10) break; } if (test(z)) break; }
The rule is that a break
statement terminates the smallest while
statement that encloses it


Iteration and the stack model

As far as the stack model is concerned, iteration
primitives aren't much different than conditional statements.

They simply manipulate the program counter
These primitives are sometimes called Control
Flow primitives



Fencepost errors

With iteration (and also, with recursion) it
becomes very easy to make fencepost errors
Suppose you want to build a 10' fence, and you
need to install posts which are 1' apart

How many fenceposts do you need?void
nastybug(){int count;count = 10;while
(count > 0) { count = count - 1;something(1/count); }}

This kind of bug is hard to find, in general
