Becoming a new player

In order to become a new CUCS player, you must meet one of the following
critera,


 You must be a graduate student, faculty, staff, or researcher in the
       CS department, or
   You must be a significant other of any of the above, or
   You must be sponsored by someone who is already a CUCS hockey player.

 If you are sponsored by someone, then you are allowed to play with us for
up to 5 scrimmages. If everything works our for you and for us, then we
will deem you a CUCS hockey player. If things do not work out (e.g., we do
not like your style of play), then we will politely refuse your request
to become a player.

 There is one exception to this policy. We maintain a list of non-CUCS
people who play goalie, whom we call if we are short for a scrimmage. If
you would like to get on this list, drop us a line.


Keeping in touch

We maintain two mailing lists and one newsgroup:

 hockey-announce@cs.cornell.edu
 The mailing list for general announcements. Scrimmage announcements
and team rosters will be sent to this list. You probably want to be on this
list. Send mail to hockey@cs to get on it. 
 hockey-talk@cs.cornell.edu
 The mailing list for CUCS hockey discussions. Anything that might be
of interest to CUCS hockey players, but isn't important enough to post to hockey-announce.
 cucs.hockey
 A local newsgroups that is
gatewayed to hockey-talk@cs. Anything posted to cucs.hockey is resent to
hockey-talk. Anything sent to hockey-talk@cs appears in cucs.hockey. This
newsgroup is only available to people with CUCS accounts.
