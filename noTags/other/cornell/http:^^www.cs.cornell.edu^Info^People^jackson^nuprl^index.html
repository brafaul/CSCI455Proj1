Summary of Nuprl Theories

 Summary of Theories
Each link below leads to a formatted presentation of a Nuprl theory.
A description of the organization of these presentations and of the
       meaning of the triples after each link name can be found
 here.



 core_1 (18, 0, 0)

Display forms for primitive terms of type-theory. Abstractions for  
propositions-as-types correspondence. Parenthesization control. 

 core_2 (40, 102, 347)

General-purpose definitions and 
theorems.

 well_fnd (1, 6, 129)

Well-founded predicate. Rank induction lemmas and 
tactics. 

 int_1 (9, 33, 169)

Integer inequalities, subtypes, and  
induction lemmas for subtypes.

 bool_1 (17, 67, 239)

Definitions, theorems and tactics for the boolean  
type and boolean-related expressions. 

 fun_1 (9, 21, 106)

Polymorphic identity and composition functions.  
Lemmas covering properties suchas injectivity and  
surjectivity.

 int_2 (9, 143, 937)

Defines mod, floor, max and min functions over the  
integers. 
Lemmas concern basic properties of arithmetic functions over integers, and induction principles. 

 list_1 (16, 54, 315)


 gen_algebra_1 (51, 144, 464)

Properties of order and equivalence relations, 
and of algebraic functions (e.g. commutativity 
associativity).   
 

 sets_1 (18, 52, 133)

Family of classes for types with computable equality and 
inequality relations. 

 groups_1 (50, 199, 752)

Family of classes for monoids and groups. 
Summations with indices from integer subranges. Exponential functions.

 perms_1 (21, 80, 623)


 perms_2 (5, 34, 422)

Introduces the binary relations on lists `is a permutation of', 
`is a permutation of up to', and `is equivalent up to'.

 list_2 (21, 94, 638)

Introduces a variety of standard list-related functions, 
that assume that list elements come from a type 
or monoid with decidable equality.

 rings_1 (44, 126, 376)

Family of classes for rings, integral domains  
and fields. Ideals and quotient rings. Sums and products.

 mset (25, 112, 592)

Finite multisets and finite sets. Summation 
with indices drawn from multisets. Defines ADT 
for free abelian monoids, and demonstrates an instance 
of this ADT using multisets.  

 factor_1 (16, 61, 386)

Divisibility theory for monoids with cancellation.  
Develops theorems characterizing when factorizations are 
unique and derives from these the fundamental theorem of 
arithmetic.
