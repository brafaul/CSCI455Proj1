if i publish it, it is true.


some of my writings
i've not had much published, but i have written some things i'm proud
of.  some of them have been flames of mine, and others have been more
thought out.  as a conscientious objector to all armed conflict, my
first published letter was published in the grand rapids press a few
years back during the gulf war.  since that time, however, i've
started keeping more of my work online.

lest you wonder, i also do write poetry and other things.  but i'd
probably rather be famous as an essayist anyhow--i like to argue.

so here's some of my writings:

there's a dreadful mess going on in byron center, which is a
suburb 5 miles from where i went to high school.  so i wrote a letter.
the unabomber suspect was a mathematician.  so all mathematicians
are suspected terrorists?  i don't think so...so i wrote a letter to the editor of my newspaper.
my most widely read letter almost
certainly was a letter i had published in utne reader a while back.
this is a letter i sent them with which i was
much more proud.  no accounting for taste.
i had a letter printed in the tech a couple years back, about
the undergraduate association at mit.  
i also published a letter in the same
newspaper, regarding gay and lesbian issues.
i'm in the process of writing a letter on
rotc policies at cornell.
i wrote a bitchy letter to the
cornell review recently.  what humorless schmucks.

and yes, i like to argue.
