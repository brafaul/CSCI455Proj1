 Ensemble 


 THE ENSEMBLE DISTRIBUTED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 


Ensemble is the next generation of the Horus group
communication toolkit, also developed at  Cornell
University. Visit the Horus page for more information about Horus, papers on
group communication, and pointers to other sites with related information.

Language support Note that the current distribution primarily provides
support for applications developed in the ML programming language.  However,
interfaces to several other languages are under developlment and will be made
available soon.  (You can check out our roadmap for future
development to see what our plans are.)

ML: Ensemble is implemented in the Objective Caml programming language (a
dialect of ML).  The use of ML supports a variety of optimizations that enable
Ensemble to achieve communication latencies an order of magnitude faster than Horus
(although the current distribution does not enable these optimizations).

C: Ensemble supports an interface to C, a prototype appears in the current
distribution.  This interface is being expanded upon to provide complete support for
C applications.

C++: Also under development are two C++ interfaces: the  Horus Object
Tools (HOT) interface, and 
Electra  (a Corba object request broker interface).

Java: Finally, work is being to interface Ensemble to Java and to wrap Ensemble
as a Netscape plug-in.

Building applications with Ensemble For an application builder, Ensemble
provides a library of protocols that can be used for quickly building complex
distributed applications.  An application registers 10 or so event handlers with
Ensemble, and then the Ensemble protocols handle the details of reliably sending and
receiving messages, transferring state, implementing security, detecting failures,
and managing reconfigurations in the system.

A research tool For a distributed systems researcher, Ensemble is a highly
modular and reconfigurable toolkit.  The high-level protocols provided to
applications are really stacks of tiny protocol "layers."  These protocol layers each
implement several simple properties: they are composed to provide sets of high-level
properties, such as total ordering, security, virtual synchrony, etc....  Individual
layers can be modified or rebuilt to experiment with new properties or change the
performance characteristics of the system.  This makes Ensemble a very flexible
platform on which to do research.
