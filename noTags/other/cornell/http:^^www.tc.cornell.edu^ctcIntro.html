Cornell Theory Center Overview



 
About the Cornell Theory Center



The Cornell Theory Center at Cornell University is one of four
National Advanced Scientific Computing Centers established by the
National Science Foundation.  It is actively supported by NSF,
the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the National
Center for Research Resources at the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), NY State, and its corporate sponsors.
 
The Theory Center's resources have been used by more than
5,000 researchers in fields as diverse as aerospace engineering, economics,
and epidemiology.  Its staff offers technical expertise in software,
visualization, and parallel processing to its users, and
investigates new, highly parallel processing resources for the scientific
community in order to increase the usability of these computers through
systems development and through examination of techniques to improve
performance.  A variety of education and training programs are also offered
to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and their professors.
The Theory Center's reputation as a world-class high-performance
computing resource is based on its:
 


Interdisciplinary research collaborations among academia, industry,
and government researchers


Integrated and highly parallel high-performance computing environment


World-class education and training programs


Powerful local, national, and international technology exchange networks
