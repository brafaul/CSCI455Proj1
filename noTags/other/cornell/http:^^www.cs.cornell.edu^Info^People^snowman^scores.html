will he ever shut up?


music gives me goosebumps...

i listen to a lot of music, and also enjoy performing oratorios in
formal choruses.  


while it seems ridiculous sometimes to make this distinction, i listen to
some very different types of music:

classical, including contemporary art
music
electronic, including "trance," "ambient,"
and "techno"
other, including synth-pop, showtunes, and,
well, other.

sorta a shame we have to make these distinctions.
