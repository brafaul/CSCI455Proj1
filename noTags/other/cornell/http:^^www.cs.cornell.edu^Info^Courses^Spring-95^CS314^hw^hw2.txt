Date Assigned:   February 7, 1995
Date Due:   February 14, 1995

 To submit your answer 
Send an email message to cs314@cs.cornell.edu with the
subject cs314 assignment 2 answers and the answers to the
following questions. Label each answer with the problem number and part
(e.g., 1A, 1B, etc)

Problem 1 
Convert the following decimal numbers into the indicated bases:

A.  333 into binary
    B.  1861 into binary
    C.  1861 into hexadecimal
    D.  275 into binary
    E.  1336 into octal
    F.  453 into octal
    G.  577 into binary
    H.  1713 into octal
    I.  940 into hexadecimal
    J.  63 into hexadecimal

Problem 2
Assume that the computer is initialized using the data given below.
(all values are decimal).  For each of the following machine
instructions, indicate what registers change (if any) and what value
they receive, and/or what memory locations are changed and what value
it receives. Each question is independent of the others and starts
with the initial values given above. If an instruction is illegal
say so and indicate why. Report all values in decimal. Don't tell us
what happens to the condition code bits.
