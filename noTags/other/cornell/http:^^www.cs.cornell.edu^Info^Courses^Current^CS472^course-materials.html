Note: Many of these files are Postscript files (their names
end in ".ps").  No browser we know of can display them directly, so you
either a) have to specify a helper application (like ghostview) to
display them for you, or b) you can download the file and do something
with it locally (for example, in unix you could "lpr" it to a
laser-printer which understands Postscript).

Netscape Navigator in the PC lab, at least on some machines, is
already configured to use ghostview.  If you try it, and it doesn't
work, try this.

Homework 4 ***Note that a clarification for problem 4 was added at 5:30p.m. on
11/6. Here is the clarification: Unless otherwise specified, you can assume that either
(1) the system adds the fact that 
JB is a 1973 Dodge Van to the KB at query time, or (2) the fact that JB is a 1973 Dodge
Van already exists in the KB. The postscript document has been modified only to include 
this clarification. *** (due Monday, 11/11)

Generic Plan for Finishing the Project On Time: It will be
easier if you write your code in stages. The code reviews provide
intermediate feedback on your progress.  Here is how I'd suggest
working on the code. (If, for some reason, you think that your
particular project doesn't fit well into the structure below, let me
know and I can help you create a schedule that does...) 
  First, think about the major ``modules'' that your project requires and the
knowledge structures (e.g., rules, state descriptions, board representations) that you'll
need (including any related constructor functions and accessor functions --- as described by
Winston in our main text). Implement the modules   as ``stubs,'' i.e., lisp functions that
have no substantive code, but that specify all of the necessary parameters and that make calls
to the appropriate module stubs.  Write the code to implement your (generic) knowledge
structures.  (completed for code review 1, 29 Oct)  
 Get the system running from beginning to end as soon as possible --- just on a
simple example. This will invariably require making many simplifying
assumptions. Design the inference engine or control strategies needed for your
system. E.g., specific search strategy, rule interpreter, move generator,
learning algorithm.   (completed for code review 2, 18 Nov) 
 Finish the implementation of the AI part (inference engine,
control strategies, learning algorithm) of your system.  Incrementally
remove the simplifying assumptions by adding the necessary
code. Evaluate the system appropriately. Be sure to leave enough time
for the evaluation --- it is an IMPORTANT component of the final
grade.  (by project end)

Lisp Environments

 The Allegro Lisp Editor  (the lisp for the PC lab)

 Using Lucid Lisp with Emacs (only useful if you have an account on 
	the CS machines and want to use Common Lisp on those machines rather than the 
	PC lab) 

Useful Common Lisp and AI Links

 Tulane Common Lisp Tutorial 

 Johns Hopkins Common Lisp Tutorial 

 Common Lisp Resouces from CMU AI Repository  (including the Lisp FAQ)

 check the end of the page for the README file associated with the data bases.)
