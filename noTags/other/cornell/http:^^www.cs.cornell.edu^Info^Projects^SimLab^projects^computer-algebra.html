Computer Algebra  
Computer Algebra - Richard Zippel

 Research Summary

Currently, my activities in computer algebra fall into three different
areas.  We are continuing to develop a very flexible computer algebra
substrate called Weyl, which extends Common Lisp to have symbolic
computing facilities.  This substrate has a functorial architecture
that has been implemented using object oriented programming
techniques.  The functorial organization allows one to define
algebraic structures over arbitrary algebraic domains.  This approach
permits algebraic structures like groups, rings and fields to be first
class objects that can be manipulated by the user.

We have been attempting to link together Weyl with Bob's Constable's
theorem proving system, Nuprl.  This will allow us state and use
theorem about algebraic structures when deciding which algorithms
should be used Weyl.

In additon, I have been continuing my work on algorithms in computer
algebra.  Among the problems I have been studying include: algebraic
function decomposition (with Dexter Kozen and Susan Landau) and
primality testing of polynomials.
