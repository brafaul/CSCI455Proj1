The MITRE Corporation

I have worked for
The MITRE Corporation

requirements under Free Flight. The project was funded by the
Federal Aviation Administration.

Virginia Tech

I performed research with
Dr. Bill Curtin
of Virginia Tech. We investigated the affect of bridging arrangements on the
R-curve and time-to-fracture of brittle ceramics. Our paper has been submitted
for publication to the Journal of the American Ceramics Society.
