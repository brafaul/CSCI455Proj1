Abstract


We describe a new approach to the detection and classification of scene breaks
in video sequences.  Our methods can detect and classify a variety of scene
breaks, including cuts, fades, dissolves and wipes, even in sequences
involving significant motion.  We use a feature-based approach, and detect the
appearance of intensity edges far from previous edges.  A global motion
computation is used to handle camera or object motion.  The algorithms we
propose withstand compression artifacts such as those introduced by JPEG and
MPEG, even at very high compression rates.  Experimental evidence demonstrates
that our method can detect and classify scene breaks that are difficult to
detect with conventional approaches.  An initial implementation runs at about
2 frames per second on a Sun workstation.


If you wish to view the paper, you can choose from two options:

HTML
The paper that will appear in the 1995 ACM Multimedia Conference.
Also available in
postscript form.

Postscript
The rather large (4.5 MB!) postscript paper submitted to IEEE PAMI.  
Note: some printers have trouble printing this out.  If you send us
email we will send you a hardcopy.



In addition, Rob Szewczyk
has built an MPEG browser, which 
uses our algorithm to detect scene breaks.  It allows a user to search
for a variety of scene breaks, in combination with motion.
For instance, it is possible to skip forward to the next time a left
pan is followed by a dissolve.


Source code  for the browser and the algorithm are available on an
"as is" basis.  In addition, there is a 

binary version of the browser compiled under SunOS.
