CS381/481 Fall 96 Syllabus



CS381/481 Fall 1996
Automata and Computability Theory
Syllabus



Below is a tentative list of topics to be covered in the course.  They
fall into three major areas:


Finite Automata and Regular Sets
Pushdown Automata and Context Free Languages
Turing Machines and Effective Computability


Each area will comprise roughly a third of the course.  The entire
body of lecture notes is available in postscript format by clicking here,
or you can obtain hardcopy for $7 from Linda Mardel in 5147.

 The lecture notes are soon to be published as a textbook by
Springer-Verlag.  For that reason, I am very interested in your
comments and suggestions.  In particular, I will pay you $1 for each
mistake, typo, misspelling, etc. that you find that I don't already
know about.  [known errata]


Suggested supplementary readings are taken from the text by
J. E. Hopcroft and J. D. Ullman, Introduction to Automata Theory,
Languages, and Computation, Addison-Wesley, 1979 (H&U).

 In addition to these specific topics, it is important that by the
end of the course, you have a good general understanding of what it
means for a set to be regular, context-free, recursive, and r.e.; of
the capabilities of finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing
machines; and of how to describe sets using regular expressions and
context-free grammars.
