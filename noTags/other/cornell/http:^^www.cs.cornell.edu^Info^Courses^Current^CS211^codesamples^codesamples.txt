 CS211 Code Samples 

 Code Samples
 You can download these code samples by using  Save As 
command in the   File  menu of Netscape.


 Demonstration 1 

 add.java  
 StringIO.java  

 Code for  dBase application (lectures 3-6) 

  dBase.java . Test program  testdBase2.java  

 Solutions to assignment 1 

   Calculator  
  Bubble Sort  

 Solution to assignment 2 

  Complex Number ADT   

 Code Skeletons for assignment 3 

  Simulator skeleton  

This shell program reads in files containing ADD and STOP commands,
and prints out the commands after picking apart the commands. Try it out
on the sample file  first.jrm .


  Complete Simulator  for JRM --
Downloading this will create a JRM.out.hqx. You might need to decode 
this by double clicking on the .hqx file. The executable is JRM.out.
The executable is a  droplet . Run the simulator by 
dragging the code file (containing the instructions) and dropping it 
on the executable (JRM.out). Note that there are bugs in Codewarrior's
implementation of Java runtime utilities that cause certain features  to
have unexpected behaviour.

  Scanning strings for register number 

 Sample JRM codes 

  p1.jrm  -
      p2.jrm  -
      p3.jrm  -
      p4.jrm  -
      p5.jrm  -
      p6.jrm  -
      p7.jrm  -
      p8.jrm  -
      p9.jrm  -
      p10.jrm  -
      p11.jrm  -
      p12.jrm 
  Output for sample files 

 Sample shell for assignment 4 

  Simulator Shell 
This shell re-implements the previous assignment using inheritance and
abstract classes. Try it out on the sample file 
 first.jrm .

 Sample JRM codes for assignment 4 

  abs.jrm  - (absolute value of -30).
  factI.jrm   - (factorial(10))
  fibI.jrm  - (fibonacci(10))
  arithp.jrm  - (summation(1..100))
  bubbleI.jrm  - (bubble sort)
  Output for sample files 

 New! Multi-Threaded JRM simulator  
Downloading   this  will create a
JRM.out.hqx. You might need to decode this by double clicking on the
.hqx file. The  executable is JRM.out. This is a runnable zip file and
not a droplet. You launch it by double clicking on the .out file. You
must first reboot (the simulator,not your mac :-) and then load the
file to be executed by using the LOAD button on the simulator.

 Sample JRM code for assignment 5 

  Recursive factorial code 

 Shells for assignment 6 

  A Sample GUI shell 
  The code for the simulator 
  The symbol table class 

Download the three files and make a runnable zip file out of them.
Study the code in GUI.java and the code in the main() method in the
class Simulator. Some new methods have been added to the JRM class
to do the actions requested, but the JRM code is mostly the same  as
the solution to assignment 5.

  Example code  to illustrate buttons,
textfields, labels and lists.

 Complete  GUI and JRM code 
Here is the complete GUI and JRM code as a stand alone
application. You can use this as the base for the applet assignment.
This code does not fix the  bugs in Lists present in CodeWarrior as
Netscape does not have these bugs.

  GUI.java 
  Simulator.java 
  SymbolTable.java 


Be sure to read the 
notes  for assignment 8.
