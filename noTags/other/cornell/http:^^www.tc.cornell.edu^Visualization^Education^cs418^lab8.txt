CS 418: Laboratory 8
 Modeling and Scientific Visualization
 Introduction. 
Scientific visualization is a term which refers to the process of converting
data into pictures. This lab will demonstrate several of the techniques
of visualization. The techniques will be used to view a simulated landscape, 
complete with rivers and clouds. The examples shown below are the result
of calculating:

 A height field, z=f(x,y), and displaying it as landscape.
The blue is a flat polygon simulating a water surface.

 A density field d=f(x,y,z) and displaying it as a cloud, either by
volume rendering or by isosurface extraction followed by polygon rendering.


 
 A set of rivers determined by plotting streamlines of the gradient of
the height field. The gradient vectorfield and the streamlines are shown also.
The vectorfield can be considered an "plan view" of the landscape slopes. 
The third image shows a landscape with about 100 stream start locations.





Procedure: 

You will need to download the program

 Landscape.net 
 Landscape.cfg 
 
The program caluclates a 2D field of altitudes to make a landscape.
It also calculates a 3D scalar field of densities to use as a cloud.
These two fields are manipulated (e.g. to derive the slope of the
surface), then visualized. New modules which are used include the:

 Isosurface module which fits polygons to points of equal
field strength in a 3D field.
 AutoGlyph module which constructs an arrow at every point in
a vector field
 Streamline module which follows a vector field in its direction of flow.
 Refine module which interpolates points into a field.
 Map module which allows the data in one field to be interpolated onto
the positions of another field.

You may want to look at the example programs in
 /usr/lpp/dx/samples/programs/  for further examples that
use these modules.

  Assignment:

Run the program a few times to see what it does. Try out various options
on the control panel. Modify the program to add the following features:

 Modify the colors of the rivers by mapping the magnitude of the
gradient (the slope) onto the streamlines, then coloring them so that
high slopes regions of the streams are white to simulate rapids, while
lower slopes are blue. The program as given uses a Map module to map
altitude to the streamlines. You will need to add another Map module
and cotrol the colors based on the data component of the field.
One possible example is shown below. 

 Modify the surface color so that is green near ocean level and white
at mountain peaks with pale yellow in between. Use the ColorMap module.

 Modify the river generator to start rivers at regular grid points
(say 5 by 5) on the surface. Use the Construct module to make a starting
grid. See the image above with 100 stream starts for an example.

 Modify the program to produce "trees" on the surface. The Glyph
module will produce arrows when given a vector field.
If the "type" input of the Glyph module is given a geometry (say
a cone) it will place it at every point on the surface. If you
use a parametric surface as an input be sure to run it through 
a Refine module with the "level" input set to "triangles".
Use an Include module to limit the trees to a band of elevations,
as shown below.
You will probably want to use a Reduce module to lower the density 
of trees on the surface.



 Modify the program to produce an animation of the cloud. The animation
should show the cloud changing from one density distribution to another
by interplolating between two fixed density functions.
Make perhaps ten time steps in the sequence.


 Some results from 1996 .

You will need to demo all of the assigned functions in one modified net
with the appropriate interactors to control the functions you have added.
As usual, the style of the program will be graded, as will its function.
The cloud animation may be in a separate program.

The
 Lab 8 grading guide 
will be filled out by a consultant during section to evaluate your work.
