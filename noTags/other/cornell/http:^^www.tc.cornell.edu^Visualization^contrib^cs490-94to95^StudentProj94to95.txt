Student Projects




Student Projects: CS790 and CS490;  1994-95 school year.
Cornell Theory Center and  Department of Computer Science.



 
The student projects listed below result from work performed for CS790,
"Special Investigations in Computer Science" or for CS490, "Independent 
reading and Research". Most of the projects were extensions of the 
block-diagram, data-flow language 

IBM Visualization Data Explorer. 
The 
students wrote code to construct new modules for use with Data Explorer.
Some projects used DX for visualization. Others were direct X-windows
applications.  
The projects shown here were done for 

Bruce Land.
