 Expanding Your Horizons 
 Expanding Your Horizons 

Expanding Your Horizons in Math, Science, and Engineering is a program for
middle school girls designed to encourage them to study science and math.


The first EYH conference was held at Cornell in 1987 and involved about 50
girls and their parents.  Since that time, the program has expanded, and in
1993, 41 workshops were offered and nearly 300 girls from all over Tompkins
County participated.

 How does EYH work? 

From the 1993 recruiting brochure:

 What's this Expanding Your Horizons Conference about? 

  It's an opportunity for girls in grades 6-8 and their parents to learn
about careers that use mathematics and science.  You get information
straight from the source.  Come meet women who are doctors, engineers,
computer scientists, biologists, chemists, veterinarians.  You can ask them
questions like, "In your lab do you work with other people?" or "What was
your favorite class in high school?"  See for yourself how important
mathematics and science classes are.

 What will I do? 

  Hands-on activities!  You have a chance to perform scientific
experiments, work with computers, study barnyard animals and lots of other
great stuff.  And what is really great is that you get to choose which
workshops you want to go to (and we'll do our best to make it so).  Each
will have cool science, mathematics or engineering activities, and women
who are real scientists, engineers or mathematicians!

 What do I get? 

  You get: a fun day filled with great hands-on science, engineering and
mathematics activities, a folder full of interesting materials about
mathematics, engineering and science, lunch, a T-shirt and a science toy.

 What do the accompanying adults get to do? 

  There will be special workshops for the adults to show them how to help
you explore mathematics, science, and engineering.  If they have any
questions about careers for women in mathematics, science, and engineering,
there will be plenty of professional women to offer answers.  The adults
will get to go with you to one or two workshops and see all the cool stuff
you are doing.  Above all there will be plenty of coffee for them to drink.


 Computer Science Workshop

The Computer Science workshop is called "Image Processing".  In it,
we show girls how computers store and manipulate pictures.  We use
a program called "popi" to manipulate pictures of the girls.
