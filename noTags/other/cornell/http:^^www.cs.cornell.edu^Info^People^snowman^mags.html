the more current, the more important.


smaller writings

dan tells you that he reads too much.  (which you already noticed.)
some of the magazines that he reads are:


science news, which is a weekly 16-page newsmagazine of science.
not enough math and computer science, and way too much soft
science.  but it's kind of fun.

utne reader, a bimonthly news and culture magazine.  its web
magazine, utne lens is superb.

lingua franca, which is a fine highbrow magazine for intellectuals
and academics.

details magazine, which is not.  instead, details is the magazine
that has a questionable relationship with its closet.  it had an
affair with a man a few months back, and told one of its female
friends.  she was kind of surprised and told it not to make any major
lifestyle changes, but it went to a gay bar.  it didn't feel
comfortable, but it really liked the music and got a couple phone
numbers.  it's also worried that it doesn't look nearly trendy enough.

technology
review is my alumni magazine from mit.  it's also quite well done,
in my view.

the onion has become by far my
favorite source for news-related humor on the web lately.  it's fantastic.

the ithaca times, which is not on the web.

the syracuse
post-standard, which is one of the best papers you can get here.
scary, huh?

any number of occasional readings, from music to art to
pornography to science to literature to theater to culture.
