CS 612 - Final Report

Parallel FFTs 



1.Overview

FFTs are currently calculated in 2 phase cycles, of communication and
 computation, the number of cycles being equal to the number of dimensions of
 the problem. The communication phase is a distributed matrix transpose and is
 implemented with an all-to-all personalized black box function. So a 2
 dimensional FFT would need 2 cycles (4 phases): 

1d FFT 
all-to-all (distributed transpose) 
1d FFT 
all-to-all (distributed transpose) 

Data is initially distributed such that each processor has an n1xm2
 (rowsxcolumns) block of the matrix. (i.e. a column block distribution) 
n1,n2- number of rows,columns of the problem size 
m1,m2 - n1/p and n2/p respectively 
p - the number of processors. 

Each process then computes the FFT of its local data and calls the
 distributed transpose function which results in each processor having a matrix
 of size n1xm2. The FFT of this matrix is computed followed by another
 distributed transpose phase. 

2. Problems in the communication phase - Motivations

Implementing the distributed transpose operation as a black box can be
 inefficient due to unused processor cycles while waiting for and sending data
 and idle floating point units while doing the sends and the recieves. 

The function starts by collecting data for all the processors so that the
 data is stored linearly and can be sent directly to the other processors. The 
nth m1 rows (of m2 columns each) goes to the nth processor, so
 the collecting is done trivially block copying a column
 at a time (the matrix is stored in column major).(B<-A) 

Once that is done, the processor sends out signals to all other processors
 indicating that it is ready to recieve data from the other processors and then
 proceeds to send its data to the other processors when it recieves a ready
 signal from the processors. It then waits for all its incoming data to arrive
 (A<-B) and then does a transpose on the local buffer. (B<-At) 

a. The recieving end: 
At the recieving end the processor wastes processor cycles while waiting
 for data from all processors to arrive so it can do a transpose on the buffer.
 (Synchronization wait) 
It also wastes the FPUs (the SP2 has 2) while doing the flow control and
 load/store operations of data from the network interface to memory since these
 require only integer arithmetic. 

b. The sending end 
The sending end suffers a lot of overhead if the message being sent is
 greater then 8k in length. (see section 4)The thrust here is to break one big
 message into a number of messages smaller than 8k. 

3. Eliminating Synchronization Waits 

We try to eliminate synchronization waits by performing operations on the
 small blocks that are exchanged between processors,thereby shifting stance
 from collective communication to point-to-point communication. This requires a
 modification in the initial data distribution to lead to an efficient
 implementation of the computation, which changes to column cyclic. 

The distributed matrix transpose phase changes to collecting a block for a
 processor and performing the last part of the computation of cycle 1 on that
 block before sending it to the processor. As the distribution is column cyclic
 the data has to be collected in rows of stride p. The processor that recieves
 the block transposes it and performs the first part of the computation of
 cycle 2 that is to be applied on that block and "scatters" the data
 with stride p across the rows. 





This loop is unrolled once so that processors do not waste any time waiting
 for data. That is every time the processor polls the network for an incoming
 packet it gets the data it needs and can operate on it. (see figure ) 







So 2 forms of waiting are eliminated: 
1 The need to wait for all blocks since we can operate on each block
 independently 
2 The need to poll the network for each block since we unroll the loop and
 schedule the communication so that we get the packet every time we poll the
 network. 

Once a processor has got all its data it can perform the main body of the
 computation. 

Limitations 

We find that the cost of copying the data into and out of the message
 packets is prohibitive. sAs the data has to be "gathered" before
 sending and "scattered" after recieving with stride p we can do only
 an element wise copy of the data and that is very inefficient. 

4. Limiting packet size 

The implementation of Active Messages over the SP2 sends messages in 8k
 "chunks". Messages greater than 8k have to wait for an
 acknowledgement from the recieving processor before the next chunk can be
 sent, and therefore suffer the entire roundtrip latency of the network. The
 call to am_store_async therefore does not return till all chunks have been
 sent. To avoid this overhead we send packets of size 8k so that am_store_async
 can return immediately and the processor can get its next packet ready for
 sending. This allows some parallelism in the send operation. 

Each 8k message is collected from the packet (of size m1xm2 collectd from
 the matrix as described in the previous section)with row stride r1 and column
 stride r2. 
r1= m1/number of rows in 8k packet 
r2= m2/number of columns in 8k packet 

After collecting a packet the last part of the computation of cycle 1 is
 applied to it before sending it. At the recieving end each 8k packet is
 transposed and the first part of the computation of cycle 2 is applied to it
 followed by a "scatter" operation into the m2xm1 buffer with column
 stride r1. The elements of each column are copied contiguously. 

This is done a number of times till the m2xm1 buffer has received all its
 data (or till the sending side has finished sending the m1xm2 buffer). 








Note that, as in the previous case the loop is unrolled so that each
 processor is sending data to 2 processors and recieving data from 2 processors
 to avoid waiting for packets from the network. 

Limitations

We find again the cost of the copying between buffers to be prohibhitive to
 attaining good efficiency. Note that the copying in this case is more than the
 copying in the earlier case as we have to collect data with stride p from the
 main array into the m1xm2 buffer (as in the previous case) and then from there
 copy data into 8k packets with row and column stride r1 and r2 respectively to
 be sent through the network. At the recieving end the 8k packet is copied into
 the m2xm1 buffer with column stride r1. After all the packets have arrived the
 m2xm1 buffer is merged into the main buffer with a contiguous copy of all
 columns. A lot of this copying is element wise (except for the copying of the
 of the 8k packet into the m2xm1 buffer and the m2xm1buffer into the main array
 which is done column wise) and therefore 
we cannot take advantage of block copying functions here. 

5. Results


















6. Conclusions and future work 

 We have seen that this approach will not work as is due to the copying and
 computation overhead it introduces. Our next step will be to look into how
 these overheads can be removed.
