Software and documentation from the Horus Project.















































The Core Software




Getting Horus




Documentation




 
Horus, both binaries and sources, are available by ftp.
However, there is a snag:  they are securely encrypted, and you'll need to
get the decryption key. Read the 
instructions on how
to obtain access to the distribution.


We are currently working hard on getting Horus documentation of the ground.
From the 
Documentation
page you can follow links to documentation that describes how
to configure and compile Horus, and what the Horus interfaces look like.
The documentation is indexed to give quick acces to what you want to know.
