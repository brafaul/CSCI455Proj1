Abstract of Algebra / Type Theory CADE94 Paper

I describe my implementation of computational abstract algebra in
the Nuprl system. I focus on my development of multivariate
polynomials. I show how I use Nuprl's expressive type theory to
define classes of free abelian monoids and free monoid algebras. These
classes are combined to create a class of all implementations of
polynomials. 

I discuss the issues of subtyping and computational content that came
up in designing the class definitions.  I give examples of relevant
theory developments, tactics and proofs.  I consider how Nuprl could
act as an algebraic `oracle' for a computer algebra system and the
relevance of this work for abstract functional programming.
