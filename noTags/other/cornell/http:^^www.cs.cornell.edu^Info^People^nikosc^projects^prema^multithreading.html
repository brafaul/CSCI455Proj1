 Multithreading 

 Multithreading 

 Objectives: 

 maximize utilization of multiprocessor resources: CPU, memory,
      network, I/0, etc. 
 simplify implementation of load balancing policies 


 Idea: Exploit concurrency in the uniprocessor level 

 Implementation:  use multiple threads of control per processor 

 Swap out blocked threads in order to maximize
     utilization of multiprocessor resources: CPU, memory, network, I/0, etc 
 Assign at run-time priorities to threads in order to
     simplify implementation of load balancing policies
