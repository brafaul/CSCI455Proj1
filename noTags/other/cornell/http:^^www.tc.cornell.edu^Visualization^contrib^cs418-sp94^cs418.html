CS 418 Final project animation



Computer Science 418   Cornell University 
Final Project Animations.



These animations were submitted as final class projects 
 by students in 

Computer Science 418
(Cornell University) during 
the 1994 through 1996 spring semesters.  
This course provides an introduction to the principles of 
interactive computer graphics and
scientific visualization.  Topics include two- and three-dimensional
graphics algorithms (perspective transformations, hidden-line and
hidden-surface algorithms, parametric surfaces), lighting models, image
synthesis, and application to scientific data analysis.
They were created using 

IBM's Data Explorer.  
The instructor is 
Bruce Land.
