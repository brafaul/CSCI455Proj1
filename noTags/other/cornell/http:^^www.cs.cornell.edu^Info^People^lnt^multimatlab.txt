Abstract:
MATLAB®, a commercial product of The MathWorks, Inc.,
has become one of the principal languages of desktop scientific computing.
A system is described that enables one to run MATLAB conveniently on
multiple processors.  Using short, MATLAB-style commands like
Eval, Send, Recv, Bcast, Min, and Sum,
the user operating within one MATLAB session can start MATLAB processes
on other machines and then pass commands and data between between these
various processes in a fashion that maintains MATLAB's traditional
user-friendliness.   Multi-processor graphics is also
supported.  The system currently runs under MPICH on an IBM SP2 or a
network of Unix workstations,
and extensions are planned to networks of PCs.
MultiMATLAB is potentially useful for education in parallel programming,
for prototyping parallel algorithms,
and for fast and convenient execution of easily parallelizable
numerical computations on multiple processors.

1. Introduction
1.1. The Popularity of MATLAB

MATLAB® is a high-level language, and a problem-solving environment,
for mathematical and scientific calculations.  It originated in the
late 1970s with an attempt by Cleve Moler to provide interactive
access to the Fortran linear algebra software packages EISPACK and LINPACK.
Soon a programming language emerged (programs conventionally
have the extension
.m and are called "m-files") containing dozens of
high-level commands such as
svd (singular value decomposition),
fft (fast Fourier transform), and
roots (polynomial zerofinding).
Graphical commands were built into the language, and a company
called The MathWorks, Inc.
was formed in 1984 by Moler and John Little,
now based in Natick, Massachusetts.


From the beginning, MATLAB proved greatly appealing to users.
The numerical analysis and signal processing communities in the United States
took to it quickly, followed by other groups of scientists and engineers
in the U.S. and abroad.
Roughly speaking, the number of MATLAB users has doubled each year since 1978.
According to The MathWorks, there are currently about
300,000 users in fifty countries, and this figure continues to increase rapidly.
In many scientific and engineering communities,
MATLAB has become the dominant language for
desktop numerical computing.


At least six reasons for MATLAB's success can be identified.
The first is an exceptionally user-friendly, intuitive syntax, favoring
brevity and simplicity at all turns without being so compressed as
to interfere with intelligibility.  The second is the very high quality
of the underlying numerical programs, a result of MATLAB's intimate
ties from the beginning with the numerical analysis research community.  The third
is powerful and user-friendly graphics.  The fourth is the high level
of the language, which often makes it possible to carry out computations in a
line or two of MATLAB that would require dozens or hundreds of lines
in Fortran or C.  (The ability to link with Fortran or C programs
is also provided.)  The fifth is MATLAB's easy extensibility via
packages of m-files known as Toolboxes.  Many Toolboxes have been produced
over the years, both by The MathWorks and
by others, covering application areas
such as optimization, signal processing, fuzzy logic, partial
differential equations,
and mathematical finance.  Finally, perhaps the most
interesting reason for MATLAB's success may be that from the beginning,
the whole language has been built around real or complex vectors and
matrices (including sparse matrices) as the fundamental data type.
To computer scientists not involved with numerical computation, such
a limitation may seem narrow and capricious,
but it has proved extraordinarily fruitful.


It is probably fair to say that one of the three or four most
important developments in numerical computation in the past decade
has been the emergence of MATLAB as the preferred language of tens of
thousands of leading scientists and engineers.

1.2. Single vs Multiple Processors

Curiously, one of the other principal developments of the past
decade has been orthogonal to that one.  This is the move
from single to multiple processors.  A new generation of
researchers and practitioners have
grown up who are accustomed to the principle that high-performance computing
means multi-processor computing -- a phenomenon attested to by
the success of these Supercomputing conferences.
But this development and the emergence of MATLAB have been
disjoint events, as MATLAB remains a language tied to
a single processor.


Originally, MATLAB was conceived as an educational aid and as
a tool for prototyping algorithms, which would then be translated into a
"real" language.  The justifications for this point of view were
presumably that MATLAB's capabilities were limited and
that, being interpreted, it could not achieve the performance of a compiled
language.  Over the years, however, the force of these arguments
has diminished.  So much MATLAB software is now available that MATLAB's
capabilities can hardly be called narrow anymore; and as for performance,
many users find that a degradation in speed by a factor between
1 and 10 is more than made up for by an improvement
of programming ease by a factor
between 10 and 100.  In MATLAB, one effortlessly modifies the model,
plots a new variable, or reformulates the problem in an interactive
fashion.  Such rapid real-time exploration is rarely feasible in Fortran or C.


Thus, increasingly, MATLAB has become a language for
"real" computing by scientists and engineers.
But one sense has remained in which MATLAB is only a system for
education and prototyping.  If one wants to take advantage of multiple processors,
then one must switch to other languages.  Experts, such as
many of those participating in this conference, are in the habit
of doing just this.
Others, less familiar with the rapidly-changing complexities of
high-performance
computing, remain tied to their MATLAB desktops, isolated from
the trend towards multiprocessors.


The vision of the MultiMATLAB project has been to
bridge this gap.  Think of a user who finds him- or herself computing
happily in MATLAB, but frustrated by the time it takes to rerun
the program for six different boundary conditions, or a dozen
different parameter choices, or a hundred different initial guesses.
Such a user's problems might be solved by a system that makes it convenient
to spawn MATLAB processes on multiple processors of a parallel
computer or a network of workstations or PCs.  In many cases the
needs for communication between the processors are rather small.
Convenience of spreading the problem
across machines and collecting the results numerically or
graphically is paramount.


The MultiMATLAB project is exploring one approach
for making this kind of computing possible.
We do not at the outset aim for fine-grained parallelism or
for peak performance of the kind
needed for the grand challenge problems of computational science.
Instead, following the philosophy that has made MATLAB so successful,
we require reasonable efficiency but
put the premium on ease of use.  A key principle is that
MATLAB itself -- not a home-grown facsimile, which would have little
chance of keeping up with the ever-expanding
features of the commercial product -- must be run on multiple processors.
Our vision is that a user must be able to learn enough in five
minutes to become intrigued by the system and begin to use it.


2. Using MultiMATLAB
2.1. Start, Nproc, Eval, ID

Each MultiMATLAB command begins with an initial upper-case letter.
We illustrate how the system is used before describing its
implementation.

Suppose the first author is sitting at her workstation in the
Theory Center, connected
to a node of the IBM SP2, running MATLAB.  After a time she decides
to start MATLAB on five new processors.  She types


Start(5)


MATLAB is then started on five additional processors taken from
a predetermined list.
Or perhaps the second author is a sitting at a machine connected
to Cornell's Computer Science Department network.  He
types


Start(['gemini'; 'orion'; 'rigel'; 'castor'; 'pollux'])


Now MATLAB is started on the five processors with the names
indicated.  (Some names could be repeated, in which case multiple
MATLAB processes would be started on a single processor.)
In either case, when all the processes are started the message is returned,


6 MultiMATLAB processes running.


This total number of processors can subsequently
be accessed by the MultiMATLAB command Nproc.


The standard MultiMATLAB command for executing commands on
one or more processors is Eval.
If the user now types


Eval( 'sqrt(2)' )

then the MATLAB command sqrt(2) is executed
on all six processors.
The result is six repetitions of 1.4142,
which is not very interesting.
On the other hand the command


Eval( 'ID' )

calls the MultiMATLAB command ID
on each of the processors running.  This command
returns the number of the current process, an integer
from 0 to Nproc-1.  Running it on all
nodes might give the result


ans = 0
ans = 1
ans = 5
ans = 2
ans = 3
ans = 4

The ordering of these numbers is arbitrary,
since the processors are not synchronized and output
is sent to the master process as soon as it is ready.
(It is a good idea to
type Eval('format compact') at the beginning
to keep the
output from the various processes as condensed as possible.)
The command


Eval( 'ID^ID' )

might produce


ans = 1
ans = 1
ans = 256
ans = 3125
ans = 27
ans = 4


In the above examples, in keeping with our orientation toward
SPMD programming, each command passed to Eval was
executed on all MATLAB processes.  Alternatively, one can
select a subset of the processes by passing two arguments to
the Eval command, the first being
a vector of process IDs.  Thus


Eval( [4 5] , 'cond(hilb(ID))' )

might return

ans = 1.5514e+04
ans = 4.7661e+05
,

the condition numbers of the Hilbert matrices of dimensions
4 and 5, and


Eval( 0:2:4 , 'quad(''exp'',ID,ID+1)' )



might return

ans = 1.7183
ans = 93.8151
ans = 12.6965


the integrals of ex from n to
n+1 for n = 0, 2, and 4.
Note how the double quote is used to obtain a string
within a string.  This calling of the MATLAB command
quad gives a hint of the high-level power
available that is so characteristic of MATLAB.  In this
case, adaptive numerical quadrature has been carried out
to compute the desired integral.  MATLAB users are
accustomed to treating problems like integration, zerofinding,
minimization, and computation of eigenvalues as routine
matters to be handled silently by appropriate single-word commands.


None of these examples were costly enough for the use of
multiple processors to serve much purpose, but it is
easy to devise such examples.  Suppose we want to
find the spectral radii (maximum of the absolute values of the
eigenvalues) of six
matrices of dimension 400.  The command


Eval( 'max(abs(eig(randn(400))))' )


does not do the trick; we get six copies of the number
20.8508, since the random number generators deliver
identical results on all processors.  Preceding the eigenvalue
computation by


Eval( 'randn(''seed'',ID)' ),


however, leads to the result desired:


ans = 20.9729
ans = 20.8508
ans = 21.0364
ans = 21.0312
ans = 21.6540
ans = 20.4072

(The spectral radius of an n by n
random matrix is approximately the square root of n,
for large n.)  In a typical experiment
this example might run in 23 seconds on six thin
nodes of our SP2; the elapsed time would be six times greater
if one used a for loop on a single machine.
Of course, Monte Carlo experiments like this one are
always the easiest examples of embarrassingly parallel computations.


For simplicity, the examples above call Eval
with an explicit MATLAB command as an argument string.
For most applications, however, a user will want to execute a program
(an m-file) rather than a single line of text.  A command such as


Eval( 'filename' )

achieves this effect.

2.2. Put, Get

So far, we have not communicated between processes except
to send screen output to the master process.  Of course, a nontrivial
MultiMATLAB system depends on such communication.


One form of communication we have implemented is puts and gets,
executable solely by the master MATLAB process.  For example,
the command


Put(1:4,'A'),

sends the matrix A from the master process 0
to processes 1 through 4; an
optional argument permits the name of A to
be changed at the destination.  The command


Get(3,'B'),

gets the matrix B back from process 3 to the master.

2.3. Send, Recv, Probe, Barrier

More general point-to-point communication is accomplished by send and receive
commands, which can be executed on any of the MATLAB processes.
For example, the sequence


x = [pi pi^2];
Send(3,x)
Eval(3, 'Recv' )


passes a message containing a 2-vector from the master
process to process 3, leading to the output


3.1416   9.8696


An optional argument can be added in Recv
to specify the source.  Another optional argument may be added
in both Send and Recv to
specify a message tag so as to ensure that
sends and receives are properly matched and to aid in error
checking.
The command


Probe,

run on any process, again with optional source process
number and message tag, returns 1 (true) if a message
has arrived from the indicated source with the indicated tag,
otherwise 0 (false).


SPMD programs can be built upon
Send and Recv commands.  Typically
the program contains if and else commands
that specify different actions for different processes.
For example, suppose the m-file cycle.m consists of
the following program:


if ID==0                % first process: send
   a = 1
   Send(ID+1,a)
elseif ID == Nproc-1    % last process: receive and double
   a = 2*Recv
else                    % middle processes: receive, double, and send
   a = 2*Recv
   Send(ID+1,a)
end;


Process 0 creates the variable a with value 1
and sends it to process 1.  Process 1 receives the message,
doubles the value of a, and sends it along to process
2; and so on.  If there are six processors the command
Eval( 'cycle' ) produces the output


a = 1
a = 2
a = 4
a = 8
a = 16
a = 32


The processes run asynchronously, but since each
Send command is only executed after the corresponding
Recv has completed, the proper sequence of computations
and final value 32 are guaranteed so long as all of the
nodes are functioning.


Alternatively, a MultiMATLAB command is
available for explicit synchronization.  The command


Barrier


returns only when called on each process.

2.4. Bcast, Min, Max, Sum

Although Send takes a vector of processor
IDs as its destination list, the underlying idea is
that of point-to-point communication.  For more efficient
communication between multiple processes, as well as greater
convenience for the programmer, MultiMATLAB also has various commands
for collective communication.  These commands must be
evaluated simultaneously on all processes.


The Bcast command is used to broadcast a matrix from
one process to all other processes, using a tree-structured algorithm.
For example,


Eval( 'Bcast(1,ID)' )


returns the number 1 on all processes.  Bcast is much more
efficient than a corresponding Send and Recv.


The same kind of a tree algorithm is used for various computations
that reduce data from many processes to one.  For example, the commands 
Min, Max, and Sum
compute vectors obtained by reducing data over the copies of a vector or
matrix located on all processors.   Thus the command


Eval( 'Sum(1,[1 ID Nproc])' )


executed on six processes will return the vector

[6 15 36]

to process 1.
If the first argument is omitted, the result is returned (broadcast) to
all processes.

2.5. Higher-level MultiMATLAB Commands

The MultiMATLAB commands described so far represent
communication primitives as they are used in the
message-passing paradigm of programming.  One of the aims of this
project, however, is to provide also an interface at a higher level
by building on these routines, hiding
as much of the message passing as possible.


We can do this
by taking a data-parallel approach in a simplistic fashion.  We have
developed a number of routines such as Distribute and
Collect that
allow a user to distribute a matrix or to collect a set of matrices
into one large matrix.  These functions operate using a mask that
indicates which processors hold which portions of the matrix.  This
allows us also to develop routines such as Shift
and Copy that are useful in data-parallel computing,
keeping the communication to a more abstract level.


Additional geometry routines such as Grid and Coord
have also been constructed that allow the user to create
a grid of processors in 1,2 or 3 dimensions. These
provide a powerful tool for more sophisticated parallel coding.  An optional
argument on the communication routines allows communication within a
given set of nodes, for example along a column or row of the grid.
We do not give further details, as these facilities are under development.


3. Multiprocessor Graphics

One of the great strengths of MATLAB is graphics.  A primary
goal of the MultiMATLAB project has been to ensure that this
strength carries over to multiprocessor computations.


In many applications, the user will find it most convenient to
compute on multiple processors but produce plots on the master 
process, after sending data as necessary.  Equally often, however,
it may be desirable to produce plots in a distributed fashion that
are then sent to the user's screen.  This can be particularly useful
when one wishes to monitor the progress of computations on several
processors graphically.


We have found the following simple method of doing this to be very useful.
As mentioned above, many calculations
with a geometric flavor divide easily into, say, four or eight
subdomains assigned to a corresponding set of processors.  We
set up a MATLAB figure window in each process and arrange them in
a grid on the screen.  This is easily done using standard MATLAB
handle graphics commands, and we expect shortly to develop
MultiMATLAB commands for this purpose that are integrated with
the grid operations mentioned earlier.


The figure below shows an example of
this kind of computing;
in this case we have a 4 by 1 grid
of windows.  In this particular example, what has been
computed are the pseudospectra of a 64 by 64 matrix known as
the "Grcar matrix" [17]. 
This is an easy application for MultiMATLAB
since the computation requires a very large number of floating point
operations (1024
singular value decompositions of dimension 64 by 64) but minimal communication
(just the global minimum and maximum
of the data with Min and Max,
so that all panels can be on the same scale). 






Another kind of application that might benefit from this kind of graphics would be
as follows.  Suppose we wish to solve the wave equation by an explicit
finite difference scheme and watch waves bounce around in the computational
domain.   It is a straightforward matter to divide the computation into
a grid of processors as in the figure above, communicating just one row
or column of boundary data to adjacent processors at each step.  Waves
can then be seen to propagate from one window to another.  This kind
of visualization can be very convenient for interactive experimentation, and
higher-quality plots can be produced at selected time steps as necessary
by sending data to a single processor.


Our second computed example illustrates the use of multiple
figure windows for monitoring a process of numerical optimization.
MATLAB contains powerful programs
for minimization of functions of several variables; one of the original such
programs is fminu.  Unfortunately, such programs generally
find local minima, not global ones.  If one requires the global minimum
it is customary to run the search multiple times from distinct initial points,
which in many cases might as well be taken to be random.  With sufficiently
many trials leading to a single smallest minimum found over and over again,
one acquires confidence that the global minimum has been found, but the
cost of this confidence may be considerable computing time.


Such a problem is easily parallelizable, and the next figure
shows a case
in which it has been distributed to four processors.  A function
f(x,y) of two variables has been constructed that has many local
minima but just one global minimum, the value 0 taken at the origin.
On each of four processors, the optimization is carried out from twenty
random initial points, and the result is displayed in the corresponding figure
window as a straight line from the initial guess to the converged value.
The background curves are contours of the objective function 
f(x,y).  Note that in three of the windows, the smallest
value obtained is f(x,y)=0.1935, whereas the fourth window
has found the global minimum f(x,y)=0. 






In these examples we have set up a grid of windows, one to each processor.
As an alternative it might be desirable sometimes to have multiple MATLAB processes
all draw to one common window.
This arrangement is possible within XWindows, for example.  However,
it is not possible within MultiMATLAB at present, because a figure's window ID
is a read-only property in the current version of MATLAB, which cannot be
set or reset by the user.



4. Implementation of MultiMATLAB

MultiMATLAB is built upon 
MPI
(Message Passing Interface), a
highly functional and portable message passing standard
[7,
13].
Here is a brief description of how the system is put together.


The system is written using 
MPICH,
a popular and freely available implementation of
MPI developed at Argonne National Laboratory and Mississippi State University
[6].
In particular, MultiMATLAB
uses the P4 communication layer within MPICH, allowing it to run over a
heterogeneous network of workstations. In building upon MPICH, we believe
we have developed a portable and extensible system, in that anyone
can freely get a copy of the software and it will run on many systems.
Versions of MPICH are beginning to become available that run on PCs
running Windows, and we expect soon to experiment with
MultiMATLAB on those platforms.


The MultiMATLAB Start command builds a P4 process group file
of remote hosts, which are either explicitly specified
by the user or taken from a default list, and then initializes MPICH.
MATLAB processes are then started on the remote
hosts.  Each process iterates over a simple loop, waiting for and
executing commands received from the user's interactive
MATLAB process.  The user may use a Quit command to shut down the
slaves and exit MultiMATLAB.  Additionally, if the user quits MATLAB
during a MultiMATLAB session, the slaves are automatically shut down.


One limitation of MPI, which was not designed for this
particular kind of interactive
use, is that a running program cannot spawn additional processes.
A consequence of this limitation is that once MultiMATLAB is running
on multiple processors, it is not possible to add further processors to the
list except by quitting and starting again.
It is expected that this limitation of MPI will be removed in
the extension of MPI under development known as
MPI 2.


At the user level, MultiMATLAB consists of a collection of
commands such as Send, for example.  Such a command
is written as a C file called Send.c, which is interfaced
to MATLAB via the standard
MATLAB Fortran/C/C++ interface system known as MEX.
Within MPI, many variants on sends and receives are defined.
MultiMATLAB is currently built upon the standard send and receive variants,
which employ buffered communication for most messages and synchronous
communication for very large ones.  Our underlying MPI sends and receives
are both blocking operations, to ensure that no data is overwritten,
but to the MultiMATLAB programmer,
the semantics is that Recv is blocking
while Send is non-blocking.


Higher-level MultiMATLAB commands are usually built on
higher-level MPI commands.
For example,
Bcast and
Min and
Max and
Sum are built on MPI collective communication routines,
and Grid
and Coord are built on MPI routines that support
cartesian topologies.


It should be stressed that MultiMATLAB allows MPI
routines direct access to MATLAB data.
As a result, MultiMATLAB does not incur any extra copying
costs over MPICH, so it is reasonable to expect that its
efficiency should be comparable.  Our experiments show
that this is indeed approximately the case.  Here are the
results of a typical experiment:


     size of matrix      round-trip latency
     (# of doubles)        (milliseconds)
                        MPICH    MultiMATLAB       
       
            25            2.5            4.7
            50            2.1            6.7
           100            2.8           12.6
           200            4.4           15.1
           400            9.3           20.0
           800           18.2           21.1
          1600           35.8           38.4
          3200           80.8           81.9
          6400          165.8          175.7
         12800          339.6          360.8
         25600          708.9          698.7
         51200         1397.4         1406.0
        102400         2744.7         2850.3

     
The table compares round-trip latencies for a MultiMATLAB code with
those for an equivalent C code using MPICH, and reveals
that MultiMATLAB does add some overhead to that of MPICH.
The timings were obtained on the IBM SP2, not using the
high-performance switch.
This occurs because MATLAB performs memory allocation for
received matrices.  It might be possible to alleviate
this problem by maintaining a list of preallocated buffers, but
we have not pursued this idea.


5. Related Work

Many people must have thought about parallelizing MATLAB over the
years.  According to Moler's essay "Why there isn't
a parallel MATLAB," published in the MathWorks Newsletter
in 1995 [14],
he was involved with one of the earliest such
attempts in the mid-1980s on an Intel iPSC.  Of course, a great
deal has happened in distributed computing since then.


Our own first experiments were carried out in
1993 (A. E. Trefethen).  By making use of a Fortran wrapper based
on IBM's message passing environment (MPL), we ran MATLAB on
multiple nodes of an IBM SP-1.  We were impressed
with the power of this system for certain fluid mechanics
calculations, and this experience ultimately led to our persuading
The MathWorks to support us in initiating the present project.


We are aware of seven projects than have been undertaken elsewhere
that share some of the goals and capabilities of MultiMATLAB.
We shall briefly describe them.


The longest-standing related project, dating
to before 1990, is the
CONLAB (CONcurrent LABoratory) system of Kågström
and others at the University of Umeå, Sweden
[4,10].
CONLAB is a fully-independent system with MATLAB-like
notation that extends the MATLAB language with control
structures and functions for explicit parallelism.
CONLAB programs are compiled into C code with a
message passing library, PICL [5], and
the node computations are done using LAPACK.



A group at the Center for Supercomputing Research and Development
at the University of Illinois has developed
FALCON
(FAst Array Language COmputatioN), a programming
environment that facilitates the translation of MATLAB code into
Fortran 90 [2,3].
FALCON employs compile time and run time inference
mechanisms to determine variable properties such as type, structure,
and size.  Although FALCON does not directly generate parallel code,
the future aim of this project is to annotate the generated Fortran 90
code with directives for parallelization and data distribution.  A
parallelizing Fortran compiler such as
Polaris
[1]
may then use these directives to generate parallel code.

Another project, from the Technion in Israel,
is MATCOM
[12].
MATCOM consists of a MATLAB-to-C++ translator and an
associated C++ matrix class with overloaded operators.
At present, MATCOM
translates MATLAB only into serial C++, but one might hope to
build a distributed C++ matrix class underneath it which would
adhere to the same interface as the existing matrix class.


A project known as the Alpha Bridge has been developed
by Alpha Data Parallel Systems, Ltd., in
Edinburgh, Scotland [11].
Originally, in a system known as the MATLAB-Transputer-Bridge,
this group ran a MATLAB-like language in parallel
on each node of a transputer.
The Alpha Bridge system is an enhancement of this idea in which
high-performance RISC processors are linked in a transputer network.
A reduced, MATLAB-like interpreter runs on each node of the network
under the control of a master MATLAB 4.0 process running on a PC.


A fifth project has been undertaken not far from Cornell
at Integrated Sensors, Inc. (ISI) in Utica, NY, a
consulting company with close links to the US Air Force
Rome Laboratories [9].  Here MATLAB
code is translated to C code with parallel library routines.
This project (and product) aims at executing MATLAB-style programs
in parallel for real-time control and related applications.


The final two projects we shall mention, though not the most
fully developed, are the closest to our own in concept.
One is a system built by a group at the Universities of Rostock
and Wismar in Germany
[15,16].
In this system MATLAB is run
on various nodes of a network of Unix workstations, with message
passing communication via
the authors' own system PSI/IPC based on Unix sockets.


Finally, the
Parallel Toolbox
is a system developed originally
by graduate students Pauca, Liu,
Hollingsworth, and Martinez at Wake Forest University in North
Carolina [8].
This system is based upon the message passing system known as
PVM.
In the Parallel Toolbox, there is a level of indirection not present
in MultiMATLAB between
the MATLAB master process and the slaves, a PVM
process known as the PT Engine Daemon.  Besides handling
the spawning of new processes, the PT Engine Daemon also filters
input and output, sending error codes to a PT Error Daemon that
logs the error messages to a file.


In summarizing these various projects, the main thing to be said
is that most of them involve original implementations of a MATLAB-like
language rather than the use of the existing MATLAB system itself.
There are good reasons for this, if one's aim is high performance
and an investigation of what the "ideal" parallel MATLAB-like
system might look like.
The disadvantage is that the existing MATLAB product is
at present so widely used, and so extensive in its
capabilities, that it may be unrealistic and inefficient
to try to duplicate it.  Instead, our decision has been to build upon
MATLAB itself and produce a prototype that users can try as
an extension to their current work rather than an alternative to it.
As mentioned, this approach
has also been followed by the Rostock/Wismar and Wake Forest
University projects, using
PVM or another message passing system rather than MPI.


6. Conclusions
MultiMATLAB can be summarized in a few words.
We run MATLAB processes on multiple processors, with full
access to all the usual capabilities such as Toolboxes.
These processes communicate via simple MATLAB-style commands built
on MPI, with all message-passing details hidden as far as possible
from the user.  Both master/slave and SPMD paradigms are implemented, and
attention is paid to multiprocessor graphics.
All of this happens without any changes in the MATLAB architecture;
indeed, we have not had access to the MATLAB source code.


It is a straightforward matter to install our current software
on any network of Unix workstations or
SP2 system, provided that all the nodes are licensed to
run MATLAB and there is a shared file system.
We expect that extensions to networks of
PCs running Windows, based on appropriate implementations of MPI,
are not far behind.  We hope to make our research code
publicly available in the near future and will announce this
event on the NA-Net electronic distribution list and elsewhere.
Based on reactions of users so far, we think that MultiMATLAB
will prove appealing to many people, both for enhancing the
power of their computations and as an educational device for teaching
message passing ideas and parallel algorithms.
It gives MATLAB users easy access to message
passing, here and now.  The parallel efficiency is not always
as high as might be achieved, but for many applications it is
surprisingly good.  We hope to address questions of performance
in more detail in a forthcoming technical report.


MultiMATLAB is by no means in its final form.  This is an evolving
project, and various improvements in functionality,
for example in the areas of collective communications and
higher-level abstractions, are under development.
The current system also needs improvement in the area of robustness
with respect to various kinds of errors,
and in its documentation.
We are guided in the development process by several
projects underway in which MultiMATLAB is being
used by our colleagues for scientific computations.


As we have mentioned in the text, several projects related to
MultiMATLAB are being pursued at other institutions,
including CONLAB, FALCON, the Parallel
Toolbox, and others.  Though the details of what will emerge
in the next few years are of course not yet clear, we believe that the authors of
all of these systems join us in expecting that it is inevitable
that the MATLAB world will soon take the step from single
to multiple processors.
