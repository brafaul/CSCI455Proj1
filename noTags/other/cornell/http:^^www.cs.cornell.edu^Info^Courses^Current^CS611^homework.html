CS611:  Homework Assignments


 CS611:  Semantics of Programming Languages
Homeworks:

 Homework 0 (dvi file)

 To solve this homework you need some ML definitions found in 
     (the misnamed) hw1defs.sml.
     The ML examples from class are also available in 
     examples.sml, as well as a 
     PostScript version of the homework.
 There is now a solution online, as well
     as some tests.

 Homework 1 (dvi file)

 The second homework.  This one features proofs as well as ML hacking.
     There is also a PostScript version 
     of the assignment writeup.
 There is now an ML solution online, as well
     as solutions (dvi) to the proofs (also
     available in PostScript).
 NOTE: The test cases used to grade
     your solutions are also online.

 Homework 2 (dvi file)

 The third homework.  Proofs and ML hacking again, now with types!
     There is also a PostScript version. 
 There is now a solution (dvi) to the proofs 
     online (also available in PostScript).
 There is also an ML solution to the programming
     part online.
 Finally there is a parser and evaluator based
     on the solution online.  The ML-Lex and 
     ML-Yacc parser source is available for those
     interested.

 Homework 3 (dvi file)

 The fourth homework.  Now it's only proofs, all exercises from Gunter.
     There is also a PostScript version. 
 There is now a solution (dvi) 
     online (also available in PostScript).

 Homework 4 (dvi file)

 The fifth homework.  Implementing the polymorphic lambda calculus, and
     a lemma showing the soundness of the predicative model with respect to
     type-beta reduction.
 For those who don't want to type in the example code there is a 
     text-only version of the homework.
 There is now an ML solution online, as well
     as the test cases used to grade your
     submissions.
 There is now a proof solution (dvi) 
     online (also available in PostScript).

 Homework 5 (dvi file)

 The sixth homework.  Implementations and proofs of unification and
     type inference.
     There is also a PostScript version. 
 For those who don't want to type in the example code there is a 
     text-only version of the homework.
 The ML solution is online, as well
     as the test cases.
 The solution (dvi) to the proofs is
     online (also in PostScript).

 Homework 6 (dvi file)

 The seventh homework.  Proofs on posets, cpos, continuous functions etc.
     There is also a PostScript version. 

 Assignment 0 (PostScript)

 The eight homework.  Programming exercises and axiomatic semantics 
     exercises and proofs.
