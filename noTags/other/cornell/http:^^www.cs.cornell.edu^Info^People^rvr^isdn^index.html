The Ithaca Swing Dance Network (ISDN) is a voluntary
organization of swing dance fans who participate in and coordinate dance
events in the Ithaca, NY
area.  The ISDN currently has about 200 members and is growing all the
time.  The network's activities include:


sponsoring dances with live or recorded music
sponsoring classes, workshops and performances
supporting the growth of local dance troupes
publishing a newsletter
providing scholarships to some of the many events available for swing
dance instruction
creating and maintaining a lending library of dance videos
networking with other regional and national swing dance organizations



The ISDN sponsors one dance per month with live music.  It also holds record
hops every Wednesday night, and on the first Saturday of each month.


Ithaca has a number of excellent dance teachers
in all styles, and in addition the Network has attracted visits from many
nationally known teachers in the past years.  These have included Frankie Manning of Whitey's fame (who will be
making a return visit in November), West Coast champions Debbie Ramsey, John Festa, and Maxwell Ho,
Texas Whip master Mario Robau, Jr, mambo
queen Debra Elkins, smooth-style Lindy
Hopper Teddy Kern, and Savoy-style Lindy Hoppers Simon Selmon and Louise Thwaite from London,
and Steven Mitchell from California.  In
the winter we hosted a visit by three-times US Open Champion Robert Cordoba.

All the ills of mankind,
all the tragic misfortunes that fill the history books,
all the political blunders,
all the failures of the great leaders
have arisen merely from a lack of skill at dancing.
- Moliere




Have fun!  Look cool!  Dance to the music!
