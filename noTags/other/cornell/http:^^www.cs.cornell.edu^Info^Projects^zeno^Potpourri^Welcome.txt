Zeno Potpourri



 
 Potpourri



The project is named for Zeno of Elea who posed many paradoxes related
to the nature of motion.  One of his paradoxes, called "The Arrow", deals with the cinematographic
nature of motion; in other words, although reality is made up of
instants in which everything is still, if we take those instants one
after another we have motion.  This is precisely what this project
deals with-- taking frozen instants of time, shipping them over a
network, then putting them together to create motion.


Little is known about Zeno of Elea.  His fame derives mainly from four 
paradoxes of motion attributed to him by Aristotle.  None of Zeno's writings
have survived, but a few passages by other authors are purported to be 
direct quotations.


It is known that Zeno lived in the fifth century B.C., and that he was a 
devoted disciple of Parmenides.  Parmenides maintained that reality is one,
immutable, and unchanging; all plurality, change, and motion are mere 
illusions of the senses.  Zeno proposed a series of paradoxes designed to 
show the absurdity of the views of those who made fun of Parmenides.


Zeno's paradoxes have been the object of extensive historical research, 
especially in the last hundred years.
