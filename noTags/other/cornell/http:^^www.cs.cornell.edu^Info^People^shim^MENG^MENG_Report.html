Introduction


Although various three-dimentional display devices exist, most
computer graphics view surfaces are two-dimentional.  Thus a
three-dimentional pipeline - the jargon term used to describe the
various processes in converting from three-dimentional world
coordinate space to a two-dimentional representation - must contain a
projective transformation and a viewing transformation, the minimum
requirements to convert a three-dimentional scene to a two-dimentional
projection.

I have designed and implemented the Viewing System IV which was
carefully explained in the "3D Computer Graphics" by Alan Watt using 
 JAVA . 

All the objects are created in the world coordinate
system which is conventionally represented as a right-handed
system.  We can consider a transformation, Tview from a
world coordinate system to a viewing coordinate system (Xv, Yv,
Zv).  Here, in viewing coordinate system, vertices are expressed
in a left-handed coordinate system with the origin sometimes known as
the view point or view reference point which is
represented as the position of a viewer's eye or the position at which
a virtual camera is placed.  Then, the second transformation,
Tpers is applied to project three-dimensional points in
view space onto the the three-dimensional screen space(Xs,
Ys, Zs). Then, I projected the vertices from screen space onto the
projection space which is two-dimentional view plane to
simulate the camera transformation.  


A full viewing system will also determine a view
volume(truncated view frustum), which is the
subset of world coordinate space which is to be included in the
transformation process. As far as a general three-dimensional
rendering pipeline is concerned, I needed to define a view volume.
To define this view volume, I needed to specify a near plane, a far
plane and a view plane window.  The specific plane formula will be
presented in the Equations section of this
report.  

Since it was very hard to create the view frustum 
in the world coordinate system, I have created the view frustum
in the viewing coordinate space and apply inverse Tview
matrix to the view frustum that has created in the viewing coordinate
system.  By doing this, I was able to create the view frustum in the
world coordinate system.  Also, the three dimentional clipping should
be performed in the viewing coordinate space. 




Equations

We need a viewing direction vector N, and up vector V and an optional
vector U.  The following equations are showing how to obtain these
vectors. 
 
N vector is a viewing direction vector and is obtained by calculating
camera to position subtract camera from position. This N vector is
used when we calculate the Tview Matrix.
 
V vector is a up vector. Because B must be perpendicular to N, we need
a strategy that can take care of this care where the user entered N is
not perpendicular to M.  Since the user entered V vector is just a
estimated V vector, we need to calculate the V vector by apply this
equation. This V vector is also used when we calculate the Tview
Matrix. 
 
U vector is an optional vector that could be obtained by cross product
of N and V vector resulting in a left-handed coordinate system. Also,
this U vector is used when we calculate the Tview Matrix.
 
Tview matrix is obtained simply by calculating this
equation.  This Tview can transform any points in world coordinate
system into the viewing coordinate system.  T matrix translates the
object, and B matrix roates the object where T and B are
the followings. 
 
 

Now, we have to have someway to transform from the viewing coordinate
system into the world coordinate system.  In the case of view frustum
which was created in the viewing coordinate system, and needed to be
transformed to world coordinate system. 
 
Tview inverse matrix is obtained simply by calculating this
equation.  This Tview inverse can transform any points in viewing coordinate
system into the world coordinate system.  B transpose matrix translates the
object, and T(-x) matrix roates the object.  

After we have create the object in the world coordinate system, and
transform the points into the viewing coordinate system, we need to
transform the points in viewing coordinate system into the screen
coordinate system again.  By doing this, we are finally be able to
simulate the camera transformation from world coordinate system to
screen coordinate system. 
 
where 
 
Tpers matrix is obtained simply by calculating this
equation.  This Tpers matrix is consists of d, f and h
values that the user has entered from the user interface.  d is the
distance from the camera to the near plane. Incidently, the view plane
is the same as the near plane in this viewing system.  f is the
distance from the camera to the far plane.  Finally, the h value is
the half of the height of the view plane window.   

As I create the view frustum, I should be able to specify the six
planes. There are Xv, Yv and two Zv values.  Xv specifies the two
planes of the view frustum.  Yv specifies the top and the bottom planes
of the view frustum.  And the Zv specifies the front(near plane and
view plane) plane and the far plane. 
 
 
 
 



Implementation

In this project, I have implemented 14 classes which represents each
objects in this Viewing System.   I will introduce all the classes and
briefly go over each class' class definition in this section.

Class definitions

cameraTransformation
The main program.  This class creates all the buttons,
canvases, text fields. And this class contains user input data,
Tview, and Tpers matrixs.  Also, this
class initialize all the necessary variables, and handle all the
events that user entered such as mouse click or enter the value of
camera location, camera to, V vector, and V, H, F values. 

Viewer3D
This class converts the 3D coordinates into the 2D
coordinates to draw on the canvases.  To show the 3D effect in 2D
case, this class rotates the object a little bit by y and z axis so
that the user can see the object as 3D effected.

Polygon3D
This class is the base class of any other objects that
would be displayed on the canvases such as view frustum and cube.
This class contains all the vertices on all three coordinate systems,
and the points that would be displayed on the canvases which is called
view coordinates in this class.

ViewFrustum
This class contains all the necessary information about
the view frustum.  This is extended class from the Polygon3D class
which means that it contains every thing from the Polygon3D and plus
whatever view frustum need to have.  Also, this class creates view
frustum in the viewing coordinate system according to the value of d,
f, h, camera location and camera to value.

Cube
This class contains all the necessary information about
the cube.  This class is extended class from the Polygon3D
class. Also, this class creates cube on the origin of the world
coordinate system according to the length of a edge. 

Tview
This class contains all the necessary information about
the Tview.  Also, this class creates the
Tview by doing the followings

 Find V, U, N vectors
	 Create the T matrix
	 Create the B matrix
	 Create the Tview matrix by calculating TB
	 Create the Tview inv matrix by calculating
BtrnasposeT(-x)


Tpers
This class contains all the necessary information about
the Tpers.  Also, this class creates the
Tpers according to the d, h and f values that the user
entered. 

worldCanvas
This class contains all the necessary information of 
the world canvas.   Paints the objects in the world coordinate
system, and handle the rotation of the objects by draging the mouse on
the world coordinate system.

viewCanvas
This class contains all the necessary information of 
the view canvas.   Paints the objects in the viewing coordinate
system, and handle the rotation of the objects by draging the mouse on
the viewing coordinate system.

screenCanvas
This class contains all the necessary information of 
the screen canvas.   Paints the objects in the screen coordinate
system, and handle the rotation of the objects by draging the mouse on
the screen coordinate system.

projectionCanvas
This class contains all the necessary information of 
the projection canvas.   Paints the objects in the projection canvas
in two-dimentional manner.


Matrix4x4
This class contains the matrix calculation methods.  For
this class I have partially referenced from the code of Awwwesome
Webware.

Vectorf
This class contains the general vector calculation
methods.  This class is the base class of Vector4 or any other Vector
classes. For this class I have partially referenced from the code of
Awwwesome Webware.

Vector4
This class contains the four element vector calculation
methods.  This class is derived from the Vectorf class. For this class
I have partially referenced from the code of Awwwesome Webware.

How this program works

If you like to simulate the camera transformation to see how the
viewing system works, you may press on the viewing system.
Viewing System


You will see four canvases in the viewing system which are the world
coordinate canvas, viewing coordinate canvas, screen coordinate canvas
and the projection coordinate canvas. As a user changes the
approximated V vector, camera location vector, camera to vector, d, f
and h values, this program redraws the objects according to the values
of variables that user entered on all these four canvas appropreately.
The user needed to press on VIEW button after they have changed the
values of variables to simulate the camera transformation.



Conclusion

I was able to simulate the camera transformation for viewing system in
this project.  By simulating the Viewing System IV, I had less
restriction when I view the object in the world coordinate since I
could change the camera position and where to look at.  Also, by
having the view frustum, I didn't have to relying on a two-dimentional
clipping algorithm to eliminate any information in the view plane that
falls outside the view plane window.  
Eventhough this project performs just fine with my initial design, I
could think of some more features that could make this project works
even better.  First, adding more objects to view could make it better
to understand what is going on while viewing the object.  Second,
diminishing the line brightness when draw the object as it gets deeper
in Z axis could help the user a lot more to tell which line is in
front and which one is in the back.
