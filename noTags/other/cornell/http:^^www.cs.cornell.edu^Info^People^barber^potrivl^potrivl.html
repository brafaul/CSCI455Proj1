1.0  Abstract

The fields of multimedia image processing and Computer Vision are converging.  At the 
same time, a lot of work is being spent on making image/vision processing algorithms 
more efficient, accessible, and usable to programmers.  A strong example of this merging 
of technologies exists in RivL's Object Tracker, which has been the focus of our work.  In 
this paper, we detail the inception and development of an efficient [parallel] Object 
Tracker that is available with RivL.

2.0  Introduction

There are many similarities between the fields of multimedia image processing and 
Computer Vision.  In many instances it is hard distinguish one from the other.  Both fields 
involve operating on a single or a continuous stream of images.  These operations typically 
incur a very large computational expense.  Object Tracking is an example of such a 
multimedia/vision application.

In recent years, a lot of effort has been spent in attempting to make image-processing and 
vision-related algorithms easier to program, by adding  many layers of abstraction 
between the image data, the image operations themselves, and the interface to the 
programmer/user.  At the same time, these higher levels of abstraction should not add to 
the computational complexity of the operation.   

This left researchers and developers with the extraordinarily difficult problem of making 
multimedia/vision operations fast, efficient, and easy-to-use.  The effort manifested itself 
with the construction of RivL (A Resolution Independent Video Language) [1]. 
RivL is a 
multimedia software processing package that, given a set of images (or a set of a sequence 
of images), can efficiently process these multimedia streams and generate an outgoing 
image (or a sequence of images). RivL is implemented as a tcl extension that is capable of 
performing common image operations such as overlay, smoothing, clipping, cropping, etc. 
It also includes more complex vision-related image processing operations, such as object
tracking, which has been the focus of our work.  The tcl interface simplifies the process of 
coding an image/vision processing script.

In recent months, several developers have improved RivL performance measures via a 
fine-grained parallelization scheme using a shared memory machine and an a 
distributed computing environment 
[2].  The parallelization is independent of most of the 
image operations resident in the RivL library (e.g. im_clip, im_smooth, im_canny).  
Unfortunately, this scheme does not lend itself to more complicated computer vision 
applications.  In particular, the scheme does not work for Object Tracking.
Bearing this in mind, we established the project goal to develop a backwards-
compatible parallel implementation of Object Tracking tailored for RivL.

 In Section 3.0, we introduce RivL, and describe the generic parallelization scheme.
In Section 4.0, we describe the Hausdorff-based 
Object-Tracking algorithm implemented in RivL.  In Section 5.0, we introduce the 
scheme for parallelizing RivL's Object Tracking operation.  In Section 6.0, we describe 
our implementation of a parallel Object-Tracking RivL operation.  In Section 7.0 we 
present our performance results.  In Section 8.0, we present some extensions for future 
work and improvements in the current implementation. In Section 9.0, we draw some 
conclusions.

3.0   RivL and the Generic Parallel Paradigm

Go Back
3.1  The RivL Graph

We begin our discussion of RivL by introducing the RivL Evaluation Graph.



In order for RivL to execute, it requires a set of multimedia input data, and a control 
RivL script. The RivL script is a sequence of tcl-RivL commands that specify what image 
processing operations should occur on the input data. Once RivL is invoked, the RivL 
script is translated into the RivL graph, as pictured above. Each node corresponds to some 
image operator (e.g. im_smooth, im_canny, etc.), 
and each edge or signal corresponds to 
the actual image data. Those nodes lying inside of the illustrated rectangle above 
correspond to true image operators. Those nodes lying outside of the rectangle are the 
RivL I/O nodes. The nodes outside and to the left of the rectangle correspond to read 
nodes (i.e. one read/node per image [or stream]), and the node to right of the rectangle 
corresponds to the write node.

We want to emphasize that construction of the RivL graph does not compute on any 
multimedia data. The RivL graph is merely the control-flow structure through which each 
inputted sequence of data must propagate to generate the outputted, processed image.

There are two phases in processing data using the RivL graph once it has been 
constructed. The first phase manifests itself in a graph traversal from right-to-left. This is 
what makes RivL an efficient image processing mechanism. The first node that is 
evaluated is the Write node (the right-most node). By traversing the graph in reverse-order, 
RivL decides at each node exactly how much data the output signal requires from the 
input signal. The evaluation is reverse-propagated from the write node, through the graph, 
and back to every read node. Once the reverse-propagation completes, every node in the 
graph knows exactly how much data from each input signal is required to compute the 
node's corresponding output signal. The multimedia data is then processed on the second 
traversal, which conforms to a left-to-right traversal of the RivL graph, propagating the 
input data forwards through the graph, only operating on data that is relevant to the final 
output image.


Go Back
3.2  Generic Parallel RivL

We can summarize the preceding section into the statement that, the amount of data that is 
fetched from each Read node is exactly a function of the output of the Write node. 
Combining this notion with the fact that most of the image processing operations in RivL 
do not create dependencies from one pixel to another in a given input image, we can derive 
a simple for mechanism for "dividing up the work", and parallelizing RivL.  

Instead of running RivL on a single processor, RivL spawns multiple processes on 
different processors, and has each process work towards computing a different segment 
of the output data. We define the notion of a single master RivL process, and multiple 
slave RivL processes. Each slave process should run on a different processor.  Once 
started, the slave process sits idle, listening for instructions from the master.  
During the initial setup period, the master sends each slave process a logical ID#.  In 
addition, each slave is aware of the total number of processes "available for work".

Following the control-setup period,  the master sends each slave a copy of the RivL 
script. Once each slave (and the master) receives the RivL script, they each generate a 
copy of the RivL graph, and perform the right-to-left traversal independently.

The difference between the right-to-left traversal now, is that the logical ID# for the 
current processor and the total number of processes becomes a factor in determining how 
much computation gets done for each process.



According the figure above, the amount of data fetched from each read node is no longer a 
function of the output of the write node, but is now a function of:

the process's Logical ID# 
the total number of processes 
and, is a function of the write node's output


That is, each RivL process is responsible for computing a different, independent portion 
of the final output data, which is based on the above parameters.  The approach is 
fine-grained in that each RivL process performs the same set of computations, on different 
data. 

Actual data computation (the left-to-right graph traversal) occurs when the master says 
"go". Each slave and the master process computes their appropriated portion of the output 
image.

4.0  RivL's Object-Tracker

Go Back
4.1  The Object-Tracker Script

The RivL Object Tracker is implemented as a tcl script which executes a set of RivL 
image operations.  Given an image sequence and a model to look for, the job of the RivL 
Object Tracker is to determine where an object model resides in a given image, for each 
frame in a sequence of images.  The image sequence can be represented by any RivL 
datatype (e.g. MPEG, continuous JPEG).  The model is a string of points, which is a 
bounding-box specifying the location of the object in a given image.  

The Tracker operates as follows:  it looks at adjacent images in a sequence, which I will 
define here as Prev (for previous) and Next.  
We want to determine where the object 
model went from Prev to Next.  For every adjacent set of images, the Tracker performs the 
following sequence of operations:  it first smooths (using the RivL im_smooth operation) 
and then edge-detects (using the im_canny operator, which is a Canny Edge-Detector 
[3]) 
Next.  Prev was smoothed and edge-detected in the previous iteration.   
The im_search 
command is then invoked, which actually performs the object tracking.  The im_search 
command extracts the actual "object to be tracked" from Prev specified by model.  
im_search then searches for an instance of the object in Next.  
When im_search 
completes, it returns a new bounding-box model, which corresponds to the location of the 
tracked object in Next.   By modifying the RivL script, we can generate an output 
sequence of images that illustrates the object being tracked.



The sequence of images above illustrates the output of RivL's Object Tracker.  
The tracked object appears highlighted, while rest of the image is dimmed.

Go Back
4.2  The Algorithm behind im_search

The search itself is based on the Hausdorff distance [4], 
which is a measure of the 
similarity between two different sets of points.  The im_search command compares the 
object with different locations inside Next.  If we find a Hausdorff distance D, and it is 
within some threshold value V, then a match is found.  If more than one D is found within 
V, then we pick the match with the smallest Di, corresponding to the best possible match.

The search utilizes a multi-resolution approach [5].
  The image Next is evenly divided into 
separate regions.  Each region is then pre-searched, to determine if there is "anything 
interesting" in that region.  By interesting, we mean that there is a substantial clustering of 
edges, again within some other threshold U.  For each region that was determined 
interesting, it is then recursively sub-divided and pre-searched.



By recursively dividing up the image and locating only "interesting" regions, the overall 
search space is decreased   The Hausdorff distance comparisons between the model and 
the region of interests can then proceed only on the reduced search space.

Go Back
4.3  Parallelizing im_search

The multi-resolution approach lends itself to parallelization.  At each level of the 
resolution, separate independent regions must be pre-searched.  These pre-searches can be 
processed in parallel in a hungry-puppy fashion.  When the pre-search recursively moves 
down to a lower level, each region is again sub-divided and pre-searched.  These searches 
can also be done in parallel.  And so forth.

Go Back
4.4  Problems with im_search and Generic Parallel RivL

As we mentioned in the introduction, the generic parallel scheme described earlier works 
for the majority of the image operations in RivL.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for 
im_search.  

In generic parallel RivL, the output write region is sub-divided based on the process's 
logical ID#, and the total number of processes willing to work.  In this paradigm, each 
process is responsible for its own portion of the output region.  Computation of each 
output region does not rely upon the output of any other regions. In generic RivL, there is 
no communication between different processes for a given traversal of the RivL graph.  
Each process is independent of one another.

Unlike the more general operations, the output region of im_search cannot simply be 
sub-divided into different regions and computed independently of one another.  This is true for 
the reason that an object being tracked may overlap several write regions.  Since there is 
no communication between processes for a given traversal of the RivL graph, im_search 
will not work using Generic RivL.


Go Back
5.0  Parallelizing im_search in RivL

Go Back
5.1  A Course-Grain Parallelization Scheme

In Section 4.3 we introduced a method for parallelizing im_search based on the 
multi-resolution approach for object tracking.  This is exactly the scheme that has been 
implemented in RivL.  Unfortunately, this scheme is currently incompatible with fine-grain 
generic parallel RivL for the reasons described above.  Rather, parallel im_search 
was implemented over the original sequential version of RivL.  

The alternative parallelization scheme works as follows:  RivL is initially invoked on only 
one process, the master Process.  The master constructs the RivL graph, and performs the 
right-to-left traversal, all by itself. im_search, like any other image operation, is 
constructed as a RivL node.  When the image sequence to be tracked is loaded and ready, 
each image makes its left-to-right traversal through the RivL graph.  When the data 
encounters the im_search node, the following sequence of events happens:

RivL spawns n slave processes as an extension of im_search
The master process organizes the multi-resolution pre-searches.  It maintains a high 
priority queue, and a low priority queue.  The high-priority queue contains a list of 
pre-searches "to-do" on the sub-divided image.  
Each slave process pulls these jobs from the queue, 
and performs the pre-search on each job.  If an interesting region is found, the Slave 
process will further sub-divide that region into smaller regions, and place each 
sub-divided region as a job "to-do" onto the low priority queue.



The master can only write to the high-priority queue, and read from the low-priority 
queue.
The slave can only read from the high-priority queue, and write to the low-priority
queue.




Essentially, each slave process performs the pre-searches in a hungry-puppy fashion, to 
narrow down the scope of the overall search region.  The master process is responsible for 
maintaining the queues.  It initially places work onto the high-priority queue for the slaves 
to fetch.  It then clears new pre-search jobs specified by each slave process from 
the low-priority queue, and places them back onto the high-priority queue for the next 
level of recursion.

Once the pre-searches have concluded, the slaves have fulfilled their tasks for the current 
iteration.  The master then computes the Hausdorff distances between the object and the 
"interesting regions", and looks for the best possible match, if any.  If one is found, it 
outputs the new bounding-box of the object, based on the current image, Next.

Go Back
5.2  Implementation #1:  An Inefficient Parallel im_search

We discovered an implementation of the parallelized im_search RivL node.  
Unfortunately, we are unable to give credit to the developer(s) of the implementation 
because it is completely un-documented. The implementation utilizes the parallelization 
scheme described in the previous section.  The design is meant to run over a shared 
memory machine.

When the left-to-right traversal of the RivL graph hits the im_search node, RivL attaches 
the high and low priority job queue data structure to shared memory, and generates UNIX-
IPC semaphores to govern access to this shared object to prevent race conditions, and to 
synchronize the parallelization.  Once the shared-memory and semaphores are set up, 
RivL then forks n slave processes.

We want to emphasize that this implementation is SPMD.  The only shared data  is the job 
queue, which is simply a data structure that contains pointers to different portions of 
Next.  
The object-model and image data are completely replicated in each RivL process, and 
reside at exactly the same address in each process's address space.  The parallel 
computation proceeds as described above.  When the slave processes are done (i.e. all 
interesting regions have been found), the master kills each slave, and de-allocates 
the shared-memory segment.  The master then proceeds to finish the object tracking computation.  On the next traversal of the RivL graph, the above sequence of 
events are repeated   The master again sets up shared-memory and the 
semaphores, re-forks, and then re-kills the slaves.

We believe that this is a very wasteful implementation of im_search.  At every iteration, 
expensive UNIX kernel system calls are generated to:

setup shared-memory and the semaphores.  In doing so, expensive resources are wasted 
in re-allocating the same memory segment.
fork n slave processes.  This involves replicating not only the im_search node, but the 
entire RivL address space.  This includes replicating the RivL graph, and all RivL data, 
including the model and image data.  We believe that the developers of this 
implementation forked new slaves every iteration to eliminate a lot of work and 
complications involved in establishing an efficient means of communication between the 
processes.  



This wastefulness led us to develop a smarter implementation of im_search that re-uses 
resources, and improves performance of the object tracker.


Go Back
6.0  Implementation #2:  Persistent Parallel im_search

An improved way of implementing the object tracking algorithm seeks to reduce the 
overhead of re-creating a shared memory segment and forking off a series of child 
processes for each frame in an object tracking sequence. With a little information about 
the position of the current frame in a larger tracking problem, the object tracker can keep 
the shared memory and the child processes alive while the same sequence of images 
continue to be tracked. This way, the master process can simply put the new image and 
model into shared memory and wake the children up to start work on the current tracking 
sub-problem. Only when a sequence has been completely tracked will the shared memory 
be cleaned up and the children killed in anticipation of a new sequence to be tracked.

Go Back
6.1  Passing Sequence Information

The first issue to be dealt with was the passing of sequence information into the object 
tracker. This required information from RivL's tcl interface into the C procedures. The 
basic idea was to figure out how many images were in the sequence being tracked and the 
index of the current frame being processed. If the frame was the first frame in its sequence, 
the object tracker ran the mp_startup procedure to set up a shared memory segment large 
enough for the current image sequence and forked off the child processes. If the current 
frame was the last frame in a sequence, the object tracker would run mp_shutdown, and 
remove the shared memory segment and clean up the child processes after completing the 
tracking algorithm. Any other frame position meant that the frame was somewhere in the 
middle of the sequence and required no special action.

Go Back
6.2  The Contents of Shared Memory

The master process is responsible for keeping the shared memory segment up to date with 
the current tracking task. Because the child processes no longer contain the most recent 
image and model information, these structures have to be explicitly maintained in shared 
memory. Basically, shared memory is extended from the rudimentary object tracker to 
contain a large body of additional data in addition to the basic jobs structure outlined 
above:

the points of the current model
the points of the current image
some distance transforms of the current image at various levels of scaling and their 
associated image structures


Go Back
6.3  Setting up Shared Memory

Shared memory is basically set up to contain these various data structures in one big 
contiguous block. Certain parts of the data do not have a constant length throughout image 
sequences. The points of the model and the image in particular have varied length 
requiring some assumptions about the maximum number of points that might be expected 
to be present.

The remaining structures - in particular the image`s distance transforms have a consistent 
size that is dependent on the size of the images in the sequence. In other words, knowing 
the size of the first image in a sequence enables a single allocation that will be sufficient 
for the entire sequence. Of course, the dependence on the size of the images in the 
sequence is the reason that a particular shared memory segment can only be kept around 
for one sequence of images. Making assumptions about the maximum size of a sequence 
would enable shared memory segments and child processes to stay around for multiple 
sequences to be tracked, but we did not make this extension.



The diagram above illustratest the contents of the shared memory segment.  The segment 
contains the main job queue data structure (the high and low priority queues).  It also
contains vital model and image data, along with their corresponding distance transforms.

Go Back
6.4  Updating Shared Memory

A convenient side-effect of the constant size of the image's distance transforms is the fact 
that only the data portion of these structures have to be changed. In this way, updating the 
data of these structures in shared memory was as simple as a call to  
memset with the properly aligned position of the source and destination pointers.

Go Back
6.5  A New Semaphore

The rudimentary parallel implementation had a series of semaphores to synchronize the 
access of the children and the master process to the shared memory segment. A new 
semaphore was required, however to synchronize the reentry of the children into their 
main work procedure with each new tracking task.

Go Back
6.6  Implementation Issues

The first concern in developing this implementation was climbing a series of learning 
curves. These included familiarization with RivL, shared memory, and UNIX 
semaphores. The biggest learning curve, however was understanding the existing code for  
im_search and determining the changes that would be required to change the 
parallelization paradigm while re-using as much of the existing code as possible.

Shared memory added some significant hurdles due to the difficulty of tracing pointers 
into and out of it. Some data structures remained unchanged from initialization in the child 
processes and were explicitly left out of shared memory for that reason. Some of these 
structures however, were pointed to by some structures in shared memory. The invariant 
that had to be maintained was that the pointers in shared memory to the constant structures 
could not be changed. The easiest way to keep track of the structures in shared memory 
turned out to be putting them in the same order every time and maintaining some global 
information as to the location of the structures in shared memory relative to the start of the 
shared memory segment.


Go Back
7.0  Performance Results

We tested our implementation of the parallel RivL object-tracker on a 24 frame MPEG-
sequence.  In the sequence, we track a motorcycle as it hurtles through the air (courtesy of 
Terminator 2:  Judgment Day).  An illustration of the sequence appears earlier in this 
paper.

We tested our implementation on a 50MHZ 4 processor Sparc-station running Solaris, version 
2.5.  We tested the performance of our implementation using a master process, and 1 to 4 
slave processes.  For comparison, we also tested the first implementation of the RivL 
parallel object-tracker on the same sequence from 1 to 4 processors.  As a control, we also 
tested the sequential RivL object-tracker on the same sequence, on the same machine. A 
graph of our results appears in the following diagram.




Unfortunately, our current performance results indicates not only that our implementation 
is slower than the first implementation, but that it is also slower than the sequential 
version.  However, we believe that these results are not truly indicative of the advantage of 
our implementation over the older one.  Due to the fact that we ran out time, we were 
unable to fully iron out the bugs and inefficiencies of our implementation, and fine-tune it 
so that it would reach its full potential.  We believe that this is not reflective of the 
soundness of our ideas.

However, it is notable that our implementation scales better from 1 to 4 processors than 
the previous implementation.  This implies that our implementation of the parallel object-
tracker does significantly improve overall performance as we increase the number of slave 
processes.


Go Back
8.0  Extensions & Improvements

There are a number of extensions and improvements that can be made to improve the 
overall performance and extensibility of tracking objects in parallel in RivL.

Fine-tune our current implementation:  this improvement goes without saying.  Due to 
the time constraints of this project, we were unable to get the kind of overall performance 
results we would have liked.  We need to determine the bottleneck(s) that are killing 
performance.  Once this is done, we would expect to see performance results greater than 
the original parallel object-tracking implementation.
Integrate our Parallel im_search with Generic Parallel RivL:  RivL was 
developed with 2 goals:  (1) to make multimedia data processing easy to program; and (2) to 
efficiently process multimedia data.  Bearing these goals in mind, the parallelization of 
RivL should remain transparent to the tcl programmer.  In this sense, the programmer 
should not be restricted to a generic set of image operations (i.e. excluding im_search),
but should be able to use every RivL operator, and the processing of every node should 
proceed in parallel.  This work involves designing a "Special Operator Detector".  The 
generic RivL operators are run in parallel using the fine-grained generic parallel 
approach, while complex operators such as im_search is run in parallel using our scheme.  
The Detector would find all such special nodes in the RivL graph, and handle them 
accordingly.
Port our Parallel im_search over to ATM and Fast-Ethernet using a 
Distributed Shared-Memory Extension:  
Our current parallel implementation is restricted to a shared-memory 
machine.  However, there are is a Distributed Shared-Memory software extension that
 generates a shared-memory paradigm over a 
distributed architecture [6].
  It should not be to difficult to port our current implementation 
over to a distributed environment using the DSM software extension.
Incorporate our Parallel im_search to CM RivL:  
CM RivL is a version of RivL that 
was developed at Cornell University [7],
which allows RivL to process sequences of 
images feeding in from a real-time continuous media stream(s).  As object-tracking can be 
a very useful real-time application, this makes for an interesting extension.



Go Back
9.0  Conclusions

We were looking for a significant speedup in the new implementation of RivL's parallel 
object tracker as we moved from 1 to N processors.  While the performance scaling from 
1 to N processors is encouraging, we are disappointed thus far with our overall 
performance results.  We were hoping that by this time, we would have a fine-tuned 
parallel RivL object tracker, that was faster than the first attempt.

We are confident that a little more work will yield the results we are looking for.  
Intuitively, it makes sense that our implementation should run faster than the previous 
implementation,  for the simple reason that we have significantly reduced the overhead 
involved in setting up and running RivL in a multi-processor environment.
