 QMG: mesh generation and related software 

The QMG package does finite element mesh generation in two and
three dimensions.  
The package includes geometric modeling software, the mesh generator itself, and a
finite element solver.  The software is written primarily in C++ and
matlab.  The QMG package is written by S. Vavasis.  The mesh generator
is based on an algorithm due to S. Mitchell and S. Vavasis.

Please select a topic from the following list.
