Nuprl/WWW Browser Home Page Help

Please note: 

Choose the Back button at the bottom of the Mosaic browser
at any time to return to the previous page. 

You can use the scroll bar on the right to move up and down

to move down and the BACKSPACE key to move up.  The B key
can also be used as an alternative to the Back button.
 
 System Requirements 
To use the Nuprl/WWW Browser, you must have a World Wide Web client (HTML
browser) that can display inlined GIF and XBM format images and supports
HTML Fill-Out Forms. NCSA Mosaic for X-Windows is one such client.

 WARNING: A WORD ABOUT SPEED 
The Nuprl system is large, complex, and can be consequently slow to
retrieve and expand proof information. The Nuprl/WWW Browser system must
format this information into images and HTML pages before returning it to
you, the user. Finally, we are all at the mercy of Internet delays between
our server and your Web client. Consequently, some operations in the
Nuprl/WWW Browser may take several minutes to complete.
Succedent accesses to the same pages may be faster if your client caches
images. 
 The Nuprl Home Page

The Nuprl Home Page, or Main Index, provides top-level access to to the
Nuprl/WWW Browser as well as to documentation about Nuprl and the Browser.
Each page generated by the Browser has a hypertext link at the bottom to
return you to the Main Index.
