My work falls into three general categories:

Complex Data Types in Databases: My thesis
dealt with the issue of how to extend database systems to provide
support for data that is logically sequential. This work is currently
being extended to handle all kinds of complex data types through
a new paradigm called Enhanced-ADTs.
Query Processing and Optimization:
This work studied issues in relational query processing
and optimization (though some of it can be applied to 
non-relational databases as well). Much of this research was
done at or in collaboration with, and with the support 
of the IBM Almaden Research Center.
The CORAL Project:
CORAL is a deductive database system developed at the
University of Wisconsin. It combines a powerful declarative 
logic-based query language with a relational database.
