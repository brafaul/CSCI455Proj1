 Transition effects for Rivl

Contents of this Page
We show here "mpeg" examples for the different categories of effects that we are designing


INDEX

  2D Effects
  3D Effects
 Warping / Morphing 




2D Effects
Curtains

Effects in this categorie make the transition dividing the original image 2D geometric shapes.  

 Interlace 



 Squares 



 Smear 



 Melting 



Blocks 



Disolve Effects

Effects that make a smooth transition between images.


 Grain 




3D simulated effects

This effects simulate 3D effects using 2D techniques and "tricks" but they are not real 3D projections.

 Peeling 



 Folds1 



 Folds2 



 Strips1 



 Strips2 





3D Effects
Forward Mapping

The pixels in the original Image are directly projected on the screen 
 Cylinder 



 Zoom 



 Reverse Mapping

We scan the proyection screen to find the projection of the pixels on the 3D shape 
 Flip 



 Fly 





Warping / Morphing
This is the last phase of the project, we will study transitions based on the distortion of images using Warping Techniques and Fading. Morphing is one of these advanced techniques 
 Wobble 



Amith has written a simple warping program......
