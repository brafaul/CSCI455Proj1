The  original call for cooperation  was put out November 14, 1994.

I have quite a few facilities here for scanning in pictures and text for display but depend upon 
others to provide that information. 

The most important thing is your ideas of what you want to see and what you can provide. 
If you want to know if your material is being looked at, I can provide that information since all 
accesses will be logged some time in the future. So, get writing...
