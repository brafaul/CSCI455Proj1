I am working on program testing. My advisor is 
Ronitt Rubinfeld.  For more information on program testing,
 Hal Wasserman  has a
testing page in Berkeley that also contains 
links to some of the people who have done work
in the field. I am also interested in Computational Learning Theory
and Cryptography.
