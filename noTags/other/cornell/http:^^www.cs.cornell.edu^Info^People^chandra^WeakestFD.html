Abstract
We determine what information about failures is necessary and sufficient to
	solve Consensus in asynchronous distributed systems subject to crash
	failures.
In
[CT91],
we proved that W, a failure detector that
	provides surprisingly little information about which processes have
	crashed, is sufficient to solve Consensus in asynchronous systems with a
	majority of correct processes.
In this paper, we prove that to solve Consensus, any failure detector has to
	provide at least as much information as W.
Thus, W is indeed the weakest failure detector for solving Consensus
	in asynchronous systems with a majority of correct processes.
