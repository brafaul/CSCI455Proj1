 Procedural Textures 
 Introduction. 
In this lab you will investigate texture generation by Fourier methods,
cellular automata (CA), and partial differential equations.

 Fourier Transform Textures  
The program FFTtexture.net takes as input an array of points or user defined
pixels, then computes the Fourier transform of the points. Since the
output of the FFT is complex, the program allows the user
to choose either the phase,
magnitude, real part or imaginary part, scales the result and displays
it.

Transform texture examples: 










 Cellular Automaton Textures  

The program SurfaceTension.net is a CA which simulates the effect of
surface tension. Areas tend to get smoother, rounder, and less
fragmented. An 
 mpeg 
animation shows a typical evolution. The rule for
this CA is:

 Sum the 8 nearest neighbors of each cell and the cell itself
 (cells are binary valued).
 If the sum is less than 4 or equal to 5, set the cell to zero.
Otherwise set it to one.


 Reaction/Diffusion Textures  
The program Reaction.net simulates a chemical reaction coupled to diffusion.
There are two reacting chemicals called "red" and "blue". You can think
of these as chemically reacting inks. The inks can also spread across
the paper at different rates, refered to as their "diffusion constants".
Many different behaviors can be simulated by changing the chemical
reactions and specific parameters. 
 
One specific reaction scheme described below results in this 
 dynamically changing texture. 
 
Red diffusion constant: Dred=0.03 
Blue diffusion constant: Dblue=0.1
Red initial concentration is random with maximum of 0.5.
Blue initial concentration is the Letters "Test Diff" in a polygon font.
To step time:
NewRed concentration = red + 0.2*red*blue - 0.1*red + Dred*Del^2(red)
NewBlue concentration = blue - 0.2*red*blue + 0.1*blue + Dblue*Del^2(blue)
Where Del^2(x) is the sum of the second partial
derivitives of concentration of x with respect to x and y,
as described in the Water wave section of the 
 
dynamics description.

In DX, the second derivitive operators are calculated using the Filter
module.
  Another example 
uses the same reaction kinetics as above, but the
initial condition is blue dots.

Assignment:
Execute the programs to understand their behavior, then modify them as
follows:



Modify the program SurfaceTension.net, to compute  a CA version of 
a percolation cluster. A percolation cluster is a set of cells which are
connected to an initial group of cells. 
The automaton rule for each time step is:

 Sum the 8 nearest neighbors of each cell (cells are binary valued, 0/1).
 Test to find out if the current cell has ever been visited before.
 Compute a random number for the current cell.
 If the sum is greater than zero (at least one neighbor) and
the random number exceeds a threshold value,  and   the cell has
never been visited before,  then  set the cell to one.
If the sum is greater than zero (at least one neighbor) and
 the random number does not exceed a threshold value, 
 set the "visited" flag for the cell.  (Correction 3/20/96) 

Below is an example of a percolation cluster using a stroke font as an
initial condition. The threshold probability for each cell was set to 0.3
for the first three time steps. then changed to 0.65. An
 mpeg animation  of 
the cluster growth shows its evolution.



Extend SurfaceTension.net to 3D. Now there 26 nearest neighbors. You
will have to change the 0/1 thresholds to appropriate values. the 3D
array may be rendered by connecting it to an isosurface module (with
it's second input set to 0.5) then to an image module. Use this 
 code fragment
to map the CA array to the surface of a torus. The Mark-compute-Unmark
scales to object to lie inside the CA volume. The wire entering from the
left is a floated version of the 3D CA array. This 
 mpeg animation shows the CA array 
on the left
(isosurface rendered) and the array used to control the color of a
torus.


 Build a 1D CA simulator which fills a 2D array, one row at a time. 
Assume a neighborhood 
extending one cell on each side of the current cell. 
You might use the ForEachN module to 
control the loop which causes the program to visit each row once. 
Assuming that the 1D CA rule is based on summing the cells, 
try several rules. This 
 mpeg animation 
 is based on the rule:

If sum==0 newState=0 
If sum==1 newState=1
If sum==2 newState=1
If sum==3 newState=0


 Modify Reaction.net to include a CA component. The CA should take
as initial conditions the thresholded "blue" concentration. The CA rule
should be 

Conway's game of life. 
Life is based on the rule (where sum is over the 8-membered neighborhood):

If sum==3 newState=1 
If sum==2 newState=oldstate
If sum<2 newState=0
If sum>3 newState=0



The CA should be coupled back into the
reaction/diffusion equations as a source term for blue or for red with
an interactor to control the strength of each source. So for each cell,
there needs to be a term in the NewRed and NewBlue equations of the form
 
strength * CA

Where CA is the value (1/0) of the automaton cell.
Use text as initial conditions.  Make an MPEG animation
of your favorite reaction/CA texture resulting from this process. 

One  example 
shows this process
with a CA source strength of 0.05 for blue and 0.0 for red, and using
text as an initial condition for the CA. Another 
 example  shows a process with a 
CA source strength of 0.1 for blue and 0.05 for red, and using two
strips as an initial condition for the CA. For both of these examples,
the reaction equations were the same as above, except that 
 
Red diffusion constant: Dred=0.05 
Blue diffusion constant: Dblue=0.2



Be prepared to demo the modified programs to show:
 The percolation CA
 The 3D CA
 The 1D CA
 The reaction/diffusion program modified to include a CA.


 Some results from 1996. 


You should be able to explain your programs. You should use
transmitters/receivers, macros, and comments 
in the "Notation" field of each module
so that you and the grader can understand the program. 
Control panels, if any,
should be well organized, labeled, and with the appropriate numeric ranges.

The
 Lab 12 grading guide 
will be filled out by a consultant during section to evaluate your work.
