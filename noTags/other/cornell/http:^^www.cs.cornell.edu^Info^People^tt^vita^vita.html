The Synthesizer Generator is a tool for creating language-based
environments from formal specifications.  To date, it has been
licensed, in source code form, for research purposes, to approximately
330 sites worldwide.  Roughly half of the sites are in the U.S. and
half are overseas; roughly half the sites are academic and half are
government or industrial research laboratories.  The implementation
of Release 4 consists of about 120,000 lines of C source code;
23 demonstration environments distributed with the system are
implemented in about 50,000 lines of Synthesizer Specification
Language (SSL) code.


 The Cornell Program Synthesizer, Version 1, June 1979;
Version 1.02, September 1980; Version 1.03, September 1981 (with T.
Reps).


The Cornell Program Synthesizer was a programming environment for a
small dialect of PL/I.  During its lifetime, it was licensed to 110
sites worldwide and was used by over 20,000 introductory programming
students.
