Program 6 Handin Dates


 
I'm extending the deadline for program 6 only.  

Reasons:

  To be fair to people since I just made that last minute 
      correction and clarifications in e-mail
     Because this project is taking people longer than I expected
      and most other TA's gave their classes a week and a half to
      do it instead of a week
     Because it's midterm time, half of you are probably going to
      hand it in late anyway, and I'm feeling generous

The new policy for THIS PROGRAM ONLY is:

  You may hand it in by 5pm Friday for 2 bonus points.
     You may hand it in by the end of my office hours on Monday, 
      November 11 (2:30pm), for full credit.
     You may hand it in by the beginning of class on Tuesday for
      the regular 25% reduction and by Thursday for the regular 50%
      reduction.

So what's the catch?

  If you hand it in after Friday, you should not expect to get it 
      graded and returned before the exam
     Remember that the exam on Tuesday counts 20% of your grade, whereas
      this program only counts approximately 4%.  Do the math and budget
      your time this weekend accordingly.
     I'm going to be extraordinarily strict about deadlines this time.
      If you hand it in at 5:05pm on Friday, no bonus points.  If you
      slide it under my door at 2:35pm on Monday, it's late.
