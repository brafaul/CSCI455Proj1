 Selected articles of Amos Ron



Selected articles of Amos Ron
 all icons on this page are clickable 

each article listed below can be viewed on-line by clicking the red ball
next to it. Or course, all articles are downloadable. They can also
ftp'ed

from ftp.cs.wisc.edu/Approx, but that's a silly option, if you
are already here.
The files are postscript, and are also available as compress(ed) files, as
indicated by the subscript .Z, to be uncompress(ed) before 
using.


The files are in order of increasing age.
