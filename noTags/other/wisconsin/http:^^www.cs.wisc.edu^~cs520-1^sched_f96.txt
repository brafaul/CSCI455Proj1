Fall 1996 Lecture Schedule




      Fall 1996 Lecture Schedule
    

      This schedule is tentative, but the date of the mid-term examination
      is now set in stone.  The pace after the midterm may be slower than
      outlined here.
      (Some of the topics scheduled near the end of the semester have been
      chosen so they can be dropped without adverse affects.)
      

      The previous tentative schedule
      is still available.
