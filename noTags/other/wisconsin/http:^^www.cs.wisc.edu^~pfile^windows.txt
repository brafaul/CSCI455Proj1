I Hate Microsoft


 Windows 95 bashing & Surreal NandO Page 


A little background first: Netscape caches images to lower page access
time. This works great for pages with lots of static images, but when
images change frequently the caching breaks (since there's no
coherence) and you get stale images. This is common with news services
such as the News And Observer Times
(NandO) which use the same filenames for different images posted
during the day (e.g. topstory.jpg, nationtop.jpg, or whatever.)



Frequently I look at the NandO headline page to find a top story image
that's inconsistent with the text. But tonight I think I saw the
funniest one ever...



Get ready...


Here it
is!


I think that just about sums it up. I know you want to see some
anti-Windows95 propaganda from Apple, so
 here ya go.


The appearance of the beautifully ironic Microsoft image finally
motivated me to make this page. Here are some other surreal NandO top
story pages for your perusal. Hit or miss, I guess, but some are
pretty funny.

 No stupid steel ladder-wielding painters were killed in the making of this page... they recovered.
