 Computer Sciences Rooms Reservations 

 Room Reseravations

Here are reservations made through the Computer Sciences Department for
rooms in the Computer Sciences and Statistics Building, 1210 W. Dayton St.,
Madison, WI.




If you were running a web browser that supported Java (e.g., Netscape 2.0
on many platforms), you would see a graphical presentation of the
rooms reseravations.  As it is, you will have to use the
