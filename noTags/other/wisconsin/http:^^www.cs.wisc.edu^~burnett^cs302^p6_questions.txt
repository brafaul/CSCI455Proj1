Questions about Program 6

Questions about Program 6

Is it OK to assume that the user is going to enter 
a 'Y','y','N',or 'n' when asked if he/she wishes to make
an appointment?
At this point, you should do this type of error-checking.
You should have a similar function from a previous assignment
that you can cut-and-paste into program 6; make sure to change
the prompt accordingly.
If the month,day,hour,etc. entered by the user is invalid,
do we just include some sort of default value or can we
indicate to the user that his/her answer was invalid and then ask him/her to
select again?

Since the input is within a member function, it certainly makes
sense to do the latter.  Contrast this with the following:  suppose
instead of read_app, you had to write a bunch of
writer functions that filled each field one by one.
These writer functions would probably do error checking on their
own and assign default values since they don't interact with the
user.
To summarize, if the interaction with the user is built into a member
function (as it is with read_app), then, if the user
enters an invalid value, she should be prompted again for a valid value.
If the interaction with the user is not built into a member
function (see the HourlyEmployee example), then your
writer functions should be prepared to assign default values (or nothing
at all) to the member variables.
