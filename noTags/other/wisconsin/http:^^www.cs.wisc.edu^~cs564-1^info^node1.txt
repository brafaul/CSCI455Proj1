 Overview

CS 564 is intended to give students a solid background in relational database
management systems (DBMS's).  If you are interested in becoming an effective
user of a relational DBMS, or a DBMS professional, this is a good
introduction to the topic.  An important part of this course is the
 project, which will involve implementing and experimenting with
components of a small relational DBMS called Minibase.
Project-related assignments will cover
buffer management, indexing techniques and 
relational query optimization.
The course text will be ``Database Management Systems'',
by R. Ramakrishnan, which you can get at university bookstore.
This will be supplemented by HTML documentation for the
project software.
