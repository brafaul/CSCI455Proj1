Repetition and Loops


Conditional execution allows you to optionally execute different sections of code.
      Repetition or looping allows you to re-execute the same section of code several times.
      Example: Add up 50 numbers entered one per line.
      
	SUM = 0
	READ *, NUM
	SUM = SUM + NUM
	READ *, NUM
	SUM = SUM + NUM
	. . .
	READ *, NUM
	SUM = SUM + NUM
	PRINT *, 'The total sum is', SUM
      
      or more simply
      
	SUM = 0

	[re-execute the following 50 times:]
	   READ *, NUM
	   SUM = SUM + NUM

	PRINT *, 'The total sum is', SUM
      
Repetition is more efficient and flexible.
   
DO/CONTINUE Statement (FORTRAN-77)

To re-execute one or more statements use the DO/CONTINUE statement.
      
	        DO label count = start, end, inc
	           statements to re-execute
	 label  CONTINUE

	12345678901234567890123456780
	-----------------------------
	      DO 10 CTR = 1, 50, 1
	         READ *, NUM
	         SUM = SUM + NUM
	 10   CONTINUE
      
inc defaults to 1 if not specified.
      
	DO 10 CTR = 1, 50
      
Use a negative value for inc to count down.
      
	DO 10 CTR = 50, 1, -1
      
count must be an INTEGER or REAL variable.
  
How a DO Loops Work

count is initialized to start before the first iteration.  After each iteration count is incremented by inc.  The loop terminates when count >  end (Note: not  >=).
      The start, end and inc may be literals, variables or expressions.
      
	MAX = 50
	DO 10 CTR = 1, MAX, SQRT(9)-2
      
Normally use INTEGER values for start, end and inc.
      
	                       end - start + inc
	Number of iterations = -----------------
	                              inc
      
If start > end the loop isn't executed at all!
      
	MIN = 55
	DO 10 CTR = MIN, 50, 1
      
What if start, end or inc are changed inside the loop?
      
	     MIN = 1
	     MAX = 50

	     DO 10 CTR = MIN, MAX
	        MAX = CTR + 5
	        PRINT *, 'spam'
	10   CONTINUE
      
The start, end or inc are evaluated only once at the beginning.  Only their initial values are important.
   
Labels

The label is the line number of the CONTINUE statement to indicate the end of the loop.  Every statement up to the CONTINUE is re-executed.
      
	     DO 10 CTR = 1, 50
	        ...
	10   CONTINUE
      
The label is written in columns 2 though 5.  The DO and CONTINUE statements start in column 7.
      If you have multiple DO loops then keep the labels in ascending order and use multiples of 10 for the different numbers.
      
	     DO 10 FOO = 1, 50
	        ...
	10   CONTINUE
		
	     DO 20 BAR = 1, 10
	        ...
	20   CONTINUE
      



Conditional Loops


DO statement re-executes the same statements a pre-determined number of times.
      What if don't know the number of iterations ahead of time?
      
	SUM = 0
	READ *, NUM
	[do the following until NUM equals 99]
	   SUM = SUM + NUM
	READ *, NUM
	PRINT *, 'The total sum is', SUM
      

DO WHILE Statement (FORTRAN-90)

Tests a condition on each iteration.  If the condition is .TRUE. then re-execute the loop.
      
	DO WHILE (condition)
	   statements to re-execute
	END DO


	DO WHILE (NUM .NE. 99)
	   SUM = SUM + NUM
	   READ *, NUM
	END DO
      
The condition is a logical expression, just like an IF statement.
      Can re-write a DO/CONTINUE loop as a DO WHILE loop.
      
	     DO 10 COUNT = MIN, MAX, 2
	        PRINT *, COUNT
	10   CONTINUE
      
      is the functionally the same as
      
	     COUNT = MIN
	     DO WHILE (COUNT .LE. MAX)
	        PRINT *, COUNT
	        COUNT = COUNT + 2
	     END DO
      
The condition must contain a variable who's value is changed inside the loop.  Otherwise the condition always remains .TRUE. (i.e. an infinite loop)
      Right:
      
	DO WHILE (NUM .NE. 0)
	   PRINT *, NUM
	   READ *, NUM
	END DO
      
Wrong:
      
	DO WHILE (NUM .NE. 0)
	   PRINT *, NUM
	   SUM = SUM + NUM
	END DO
      

FORTRAN-77 "DO WHILE" Loop

The DO WHILE statement is not standard FORTRAN-77 and may not be available on all compilers. But sometimes we cannot use the FORTRAN-77 DO/CONTINUE loop.
      To implement the equivalent of a DO WHILE loop in FORTRAN-77 we can use an IF statement and a GOTO statement.
      
	     DO WHILE (NUM .NE. 0)
	        ...
	     END DO
      
      can be written as
      
	10   IF (NUM .NE. 0) THEN
	        ...
	        GOTO 100
	     END IF
      
The GOTO statement "jumps" to resume executing the statement at the specified label.
      WARNING: Never use GOTO statements anywhere in your program except if you have a strict FORTRAN-77 compiler and then only to implement DO WHILE loops.
      SECOND WARNING: Anyone caught using GOTO statements in this class will automatically receive a mark of zero for that assignment.  Just say NO to GOTOs!
   
Nested Loops

Just as IF statements can be nested inside each other, so can DO/CONTINUE and DO WHILE loops.
      
	     DO 20 X = 1, 10
	        FACT = 1

	        DO 10 COUNT = 1, X
	           FACT = FACT * COUNT
	10      CONTINUE

	        PRINT *, X, '! =', FACT
	20   CONTINUE
      
The outer loop is executed 10 times (X=1..10).  Inner loop is executed X number of times, depending on the current value of X.
      Nested loops must use different counter variables.
      Inner loop's CONTINUE statement comes before the outer loop's CONTINUE statement.
   
Indenting

As with IF statement, indent all re-executed statements 3 additional spaces.
   


FORTRAN-90 Loops


Repitition and loops are vital for any programming languages to be useful.
      Standard FORTRAN-77 only has the DO/CONTINUE loop.
      FORTRAN-90 provides more powerful looping mechanisms (aside: the DO WHILE loop is also supported by many "non-standard" FORTRAN-77 compilers, such as Microsoft FORTRAN).
   
DO/END DO Loop (FORTRAN-90)

Same as the FORTRAN-77 DO/CONTINUE loop but without the CONTINUE statement and no label.
      The end of the loop is indicated by the END DO statement.
      
	      DO 10 ADD = 1, 10
	         READ *, NUM
	         SUM = SUM + NUM
	 10   CONTINUE
      
      is the same as
      
	      DO ADD = 1, 10
	         READ *, NUM
	         SUM = SUM + NUM
	      END DO
      
The DO/END DO can be nested like other loops.
      The counter must be an INTEGER variable.
      Important: Always use the DO/END DO loop instead of the DO/CONTINUE loop in this class.  It is also supported by Microsoft FORTRAN.
   
Which Loop Do I Use?

Use the DO/END DO (FORTRAN-90) instead of the DO/CONTINUE (FORTRAN-77) if possible.
      Use the DO WHILE/END DO (FORTRAN-90) instead of the IF/THEN/GOTO (FORTRAN-77) unless you have a strict FORTRAN-77 compiler.
