 What have you been upto so far?

Well the first year I was here, I was a teaching assistant for 
CS302, with no life
outside of work and courses. Wait! I did have some fun, with
Intermediate swimming (at the 
SERF).
I spent my first summer
working at IBM's Almaden research center
in San Jose, 
California,
working on TPC-D
a database benchmark for 
Decision Support Systems (DSS). This got me interested in 
OLAP, which is an acronym for
OnLine Analytical Processing. On my return from
Almaden, I started working for 
Jeff Naughton. Since spring '96, I am supported by a 
CAS Fellowship from
IBM. I spent this summer in
Toronto, which is in the state of
Ontario,
Canada.
I was working on SMP parallelism for DB/2 Client Server.








Enough!! Don't you have a life??
My passion is 
running.
I run about 30 miles a week at the
shell,
in winter, and outdoors in summer, and dream of running a marathon some day.
It is Fall, and getting colder as the days go by. I am still running outdoors.
I want to run in the snow atleast once. 
As with any activity, running
has some special needs. It is important to 
 stretch
after a run.  Picking the right shoe to run in is an extremely important
decision. The shoe buyer's 
guide
should help you make a good decision. (By the way, I over-pronate, and need a
shoe to fix this, so I use a Brooks Beast). It is a good idea to
buy a running shoe from a
retail running store.


I picked a marathon to run. The 1997 Las Vegas Marathon on Feb. 9. There is group
from the UW running club planning a trip to the marathon. I now have to increase my
mileage to 50 miles/week.




All ye people out there who are thinking of starting to run, take a look at
some information for 
beginning runners.
Walking
is also a good fitness activity to start with if you haven't been
running for some time. As a motivating factor: Do you know that 
Oprah Winfrey ran a
marathon?















 I run because I am a runner, and that's what we do.
