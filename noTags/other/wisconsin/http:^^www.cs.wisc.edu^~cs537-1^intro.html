  History  

Once computers were expensive and rare.
    Now they are cheap (or expensive!) and ubiquitous.
    Hardware trends:
    
vacuum tubes, core memory, punched cards
            
-> transistors, magnetic tapes
            -> integrated circuits, disks
            -> VLSI (computer on a chip)
            
main frame ($1 million and up)
            
-> mini $50K - $1M; workstation $10K - $50K
            -> micro (pc) $1K - $10K
            -> network computer $500 and up (??)
            

Software:
    
Batch system.  One user at a time.  Same person was programmer,
            operator, and end-user (who wants something done)
            
-> multiprogrammed (more than one "job" at a time)
                (to improve utilization -- e.g. spooling)
            -> time-sharing (multiple interactive users)
            -> single-user pc or ws (come full-circle?)
            
Other kinds of systems:
            
Transaction processing (e.g. banking, airlines)
            Real-time (e.g., missile defense, factory control)
            Embedded systems (a computer in every toaster)
            


      What is an OS For?  

Beautification Principle

        The goal of an OS is to make hardware look better than it is.
        
More regular, uniform (instead of lots of idiosyncratic devices)
            Easier to program (e.g., don't have to worry about speeds,
                asynchronous events)
            Closer to what's needed for applications:
            
named, variable-length files, rather than disk blocks
                multiple ``CPU's'', one for each user (in shared system)
                    or activity (in single-user system)
                multiple large, dynamically-growing memories (virtual
                    memory)
            

Resource principle


The goal of an OS is to mediate sharing of scarce resources
            
Q:What is a ``resource''?
            A:Something that costs money!
            
Why share?
            
expensive devices
            need to share data (database is an ``expensive device''!)
            cooperation between people (community is an ``expensive device''!!)
            
Problems:
            
getting it to work at all
            getting it to work efficiently
                
utilization (keeping all the devices busy)
                throughput (getting a lot of useful work done per hour)
                response (getting individual things done quickly)
                
protection
                
limiting the effects of bugs
                    (preventing idiots from ruining it for everyone)
                preventing unauthorized
                    
access to data
                    modification of data
                    use of resources
                    
                    (preventing bad guys from ruining it for everyone)
                



  Bottom-up View
(starting with the hardware)
 
Hardware (summary; more details later)

components
        
one or more central processing units (CPU's)
        main memory (RAM, core)
        I/O devices
        bus, or other communication mechanism connects them all together
        
CPU has PC pointing to next instruction to execute
        
fetches instructions one at a time from location specified by PC
        increments PC after fetching instruction; branch instructions
            can also alter the PC
        responds to "interrupts" by jumping to a different location
            (like an unscheduled procedure call)
        
Memory responds to "load" and "store" requests from the CPU, one at
        a time.
    I/O device
        
Usually looks like a chunk of memory to the CPU.
        CPU sets options and starts I/O by sending "store" requests
            to a particular address.
        CPU gets back status and small amounts of data by issuing "load"
            requests.
        Direct memory access (DMA):  Device may transfer large amounts of
            data directly to/from memory by doing loads and stores
            just like a CPU.
        Issues an interrupt to the CPU to indicate that it is done.
        

Timing problem

I/O devices are millions or even billions of times slower than CPU.
    E.g.:
        
Typical PC is >10 million instructions/sec
        Typical disk takes > 10 ms to get one byte from disk
            ratio: 100,000 : 1
        Typical typist = 60 wpm = 1 word = 5 bytes/sec = 200 ms
            = 2 million instructions per key-stroke.  And that
            doesn't include head-scratching time!
        
Solution:
        
start disk device
do 100,000 instructions of other useful computation
wait for disk to finish
        
Terrible program to write; debug.  And it would change with a faster
        disk!
    Better solution:

Process 1:
    for (;;) {
        start I/O
        wait for it to finish
        use the data for something
    }
Process 2:
    for (;;) {
        do some useful computation
    }

        Operating system takes care of switching back and forth between
            process 1 and process 2 as ``appropriate''.
            (Question:  which process should have higher priority?)
    
Space problem

Most of the time, a typical program is "wasting" most of the memory
    space allocated to it.
        
Looping in one subroutine (wasting space allocated
            to rest of program)
        Fiddling with one data structure (wasting space allocated to
            other data structures)
        Waiting for I/O or user input (wasting all of its space)
        
Solution: virtual memory

Keep program and data on disk (100-1000 times cheaper/byte).
        OS automatically copies to memory pieces needed by program
            on demand.
        


  Top-Down View
(what does it look like to various kinds of users?)
 

End user.
        
Wants to get something done (bill customers, write a love letter,
            play a game, design a bomb).
        Doesn't know what an OS is (or care!)
            May not even realize there is a computer there.
        
Application programmer.
        
Writes software for end users.  Uses ``beautified'' virtual machine
            
named files of unlimited size
            unlimited memory
            read/write returns immediately
            
Calls library routines
            
some really are just subroutines written by someone else
                
sort an array
                solve a differential equation
                search a string for a character
                
others call the operating system 
                
read/write
                create process
                get more memory
                


Systems programmer (you, at the end of this course)
        
Creates abstractions for application programmers
        Deals with real devices
