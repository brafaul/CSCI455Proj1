DJF's Reinforcement Learning Page


 Some Reinforcement Learning Resources

 
      My publications

 Short subjects:

 
     What is reinforcement learning, and why is it hard?
 
     What is Importance-Based Feature Extraction?


 Simulation code for several control problems:

 
     Pole-cart problem, driver module---Just the driver;  supply your
     own controller
 
     Sample Q-learning controller module---Suitable for use with the
     pole-cart driver module.  (Currently, doesn't use probabilistic action 
     selection).
 
     Barto-Sutton-Anderson pole-cart solution
 
     Chuck Anderson's public domain code for neural networks and 
     reinforcement learning
 Suggestions on additional links?
