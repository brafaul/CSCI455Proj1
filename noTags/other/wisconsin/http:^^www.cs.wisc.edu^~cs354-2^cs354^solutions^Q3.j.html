(1, ver 1) (10 points) Write a SAL code segment that prints a 1 if variable
wd contains the bit sequence "101101" and prints a 0 if it does
not. The code segment should leave variable wd unchanged.
ANSWER

        move a, 0                # assume "101101" is not in wd
        move pattern, 0x0000002d # "101101" as a 6 bit pattern
        move mask, 0x0000003f    # used to get 6 bits of wd
        move count, 0            # do at most 32-6+1=27 tests
loop:   and  x, wd, mask         # get 6 bits of wd
        bne  pattern, x, cont
        move a, 1                # "101101" is in wd
        b    end                 # might as well quit
cont:   add  count, count, 1
        sll  mask, mask, 1       # "ror wd, wd, 1" is no good
        sll  pattern, pattern, 1
        bne  count, 27, loop
end:    put  a 
(1, ver 2) (10 points) Write a SAL code segment that prints a 1 if variable
wd does not contain the bit sequence "1001100" and prints a 0
if it does. The code seqment should leave variable wd unchanged.
ANSWER

        move a, 1                # assume "1001100" is not in wd
        move pattern, 0x0000004c # "10001100" as a 7 bit pattern
        move mask, 0x0000007f    # used to get 7 bits of wd
        move count, 0            # do at most 32-7+1=26 tests
loop:   and  x, wd, mask
        bne  pattern, x, cont
        move a, 0                # "1001100" is in wd
        b    end                 # might as well quit
cont:   add  count, count, 1
        sll  mask, mask, 1       # "ror  wd, wd, 1" is no good
        sll  pattern, pattern, 1
        bne  count, 26, loop
end:    put  a
(2, ver 1) (5 points) In the simp simulator, the "not" instruction
was left out. Explain why:



"xor a, a, -1" is equivalent to "not a, a"



ANSWER

1 xor 1 is 0
0 xor 1 is 1

so xor'ing with 1 acts like not'ing and
-1 is all 1's in a 32 bit, 2's complement representation
(2, ver 2) (5 points) In the simp simulator, the "not" instruction
was left out. Explain why:



"xnor a, a, 0" is equivalent to "not a, a"



ANSWER

1 xnor 0 is 0
0 xnor 0 is 1

so xnor'ing with 0 acts like not'ing and
0 is all 0's in a 32 bit, 2's complement representation

(hidden bit is shown). Show the IEEE form of the result, with hidden bit
showing (8 points). What is the value of the result in decimal (2 points)?
