Non-Credit Seminars

The nine research areas in the Department each run an advanced, non-credit
seminar where graduate students, visitors, and faculty members from within and
outside the Department present their latest research or discuss recently
published papers.  These seminars give graduate students the opportunity to
learn about current research problems and to get valuable feedback on their
own research.

Also, each fall the Department runs a Distinguished Lecturer Series where 6-8
leading researchers in a subfield of computer science visit.
The visitors give two lectures - one to a general computer science audience
and a second, more specialized, talk targeted toward researchers in the given
subfield. Recent topics have been programming languages, computing theory,
operating systems, and machine learning.
