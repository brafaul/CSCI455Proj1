 Tufts University Alumni E-Mail Address List


Tufts
University Alumni
E-Mail Address List



Here's the initial list.  It's not that great, but it is alphabetical
by last name.  The list is growing and growing.  Soon its current
implementation will be unwieldy.  At that point, I will devise a more
sensible database format.

 

You can enter information in this form and it will automatically be
added to this page.  You should see the changes reloaded
automatically.  

For married women who have changed their name, I suggest you enter
your new last name followed by your old last name in parenthesis.  Ex: 
Last Name: Lukas (Meyer)


WARNING: If your name is the exact same as someone
else's on this list, you will replace their information!  If you have
this problem, put your middle initial after your first name and this
will hopefully solve it.

 This page is
maintained by Chris Lukas.  Please contact me with questions, comments
and suggestions at: lukas@cs.wisc.edu
