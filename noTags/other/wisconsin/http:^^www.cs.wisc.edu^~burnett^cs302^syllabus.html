CS302-63 Syllabus

CS302-63 Syllabus
This page will be expanded/revised during the first few weeks.  Thank you
for your patience!

Exams (3) - 60% (20% each)
Quizzes (3-5) - 10% (equally weighted)
Programs (9) - 30% (probably equally weighted)

Approximate Timetable - this will give you a rough
idea as to the pace and ordering of the topics-to-be-covered.  You are
responsible for any "adjustments" made in class.

Late Policy: Your paper copy of the program must be handed in by the 
beginning of class on the day it is due.  The electronic copy will
not be used to determine the handin time.  Make sure that the paper copy
matches the electronic one; if it doesn't, then I will probably consider
the electronic copy a late submission.

Programs will generally be due on a Tuesday.  In this case, you may hand
in a program up to 3 days late, and there will be a 15% deduction
for each late day.  Thursday submissions: paper copy must be handed in by
the beginning of class.  Wednesday and Friday submissions: paper
copy must be handed directly to me during my office hours.
