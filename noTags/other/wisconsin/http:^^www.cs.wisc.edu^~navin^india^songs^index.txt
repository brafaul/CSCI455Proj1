If you cannot find a song ...
 
If you want lyrics of a specific song, and you can't find that song
in the archives, first try Rajiv Shridhar's site, where he maintains a 
list of 
latest song submissions not yet incorporated into the ISB.
Otherwise try posting a request
on the rec.music.indian.misc
newsgroup, and hopefully somebody will post the lyrics you want.
Alternatively, 
Satish Kalra 
knows the lyrics of a lot of songs. Send him a request
by email 
and he might send you the lyrics.
