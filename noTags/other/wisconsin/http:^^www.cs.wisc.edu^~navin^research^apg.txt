 OPT++ 


 
OPT++ 

 Opt++  is a 
tool for Database Query Optimization that uses the
Object-Oriented features of the C++ programming language
to simplify the task of implementing, extending and modifying
an optimizer. It incorporates all the features of of an extensible
optimization framework including specification of a logical algebra,
execution algorithms, logical and physical query processing alternatives,
and selectivity and cost estimation.


Our goal was to extract out those parts of a 
query optimizer which are not dependent upon any
query language and put together an extendible and 
flexible package with the intention of simplifying the
task of writing the query optimizer.
We do not make any assumptions about the
query language and hence it is hoped that this tool
can be used to write query optimizers for a 
large class of query languages.


Opt++ is used in the 
Paradise Parallel Database System.
