Handouts cs302-1, cs302-22


Handouts
Handouts will not always be handed out in class.  Often, they'll simply be posted here, and you'll be
responsible for reading them here, or printing your own copy.

 The First Day
 Getting Started (Links for the lab and software).
   (Sept 18) This program demonstrates the simple square function.

 (Sept 20) Short example of an if-else statement.
   (Sept 20) Short example of an
if-else controling more than a single statment.
   (Sept 20) Another example of
if-else.  This one shows an if-else statement inside of another if-else.
   (Sept 20) This demonstrates the
danger of typing '=' when you mean '=='.
   (Sept 20) This demonstrates the
danger of having an extra ';' in the wrong place.
   (Sept 20) This shows a use of a while
loop that sings the song "99 bottle of beer on the wall."
   (Sept 20) These are some relevant code samples from the text:

 if-else example (2.6) (simple)
   if-else example (2.9) (complex)
   while loop example (2.10)


 (Oct 24) A simple example of a date class.
   (Oct 24) This is another date
	class.  This one demonstrates constructors. 

 (Oct 29) Here are the files for the ship
example.  This example shows nested objects, and initialization lists in constructors.



Here are all of the sample code fragments from your text book.
