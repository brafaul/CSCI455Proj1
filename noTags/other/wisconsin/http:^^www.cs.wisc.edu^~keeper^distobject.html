Object Oriented Programming Review

Objects are individual sets of data coupled with related procedures 
used to access and alter those data.  

Important features:


Encapsulation Data are hidden behind methods
Polymorphism Objects can be interchangeable, but different
Inheritance Objects can be extended and altered, but remain
interchangeable with the older models


Related features:

 Early and late binding
 Frameworks 


OpenDoc

OpenDoc is a Compound Document programming model:


 Documents are divided into parts
 Parts consist of typed data in persistent store, and an associated
part editor
 Part editors are subclassed from a 60 method superclass that is 
standard over all implementations (not all methods need to be overloaded)
 Many parts can nest within other parts


OpenDoc Frameworks

Two competing drawing frameworks:


OpenDoc Development Framework From Apple.  No rendering facilities.
Instead, prebuilt editor parts are subclassed
OpenDoc Framework From IBM.  Built on OpenClass, a cross-platform
rendering library.  Currently available for OS/2 and Windows, Mac and AIX
later.


Clearly, rendering is currently an OpenDoc weak-point.

OpenDoc Compound Documents

Document shells are used to interact with documents.  They:


 Create a session object (which provide parts with information
and manage geometries)
 Retrieve documents from storage
 Dynamically bind and load part editors
 Dispatch events and manage global document data


Bento: OpenDoc Persistent Storage

Bento is used to store compound documents.


 A system of structured files and references between files.
 No concurrent multiuser access (currently)
 Internal versioning system (Drafts)
 Persistent references (32 bit IDs) used to identify individual parts


OpenDoc Data Transfers


 Drag and Drop
 Clipboard (cut/copy/paste)
 Copy links


Persistent references are recursively located within parts to determine what
to copy.  

Copy links push new data to other documents when they are updated.  

Scripting and Extensions

Part editor superclasses are designed so that part operations can be 
scripted

A semantic-level event system extends the OS event model

Standardized and registered extra interfaces to parts called Extensions 
are also possible.  

OLE/COM

OLE is not based strictly on the object model:


 Interfaces are not individually instantiated, and therefore have no
unique associated state
 Inheritance is not supported.  Instead, aggregation is available
 Object location is not transparent.  Communications mechanisms 
differ depending on the environment of the object (in-process, local servers,
remote servers)
 Remote servers are currently unimplemented (might be in NT 4 beta)


OLE Interfaces

Interfaces are called through vtables laid out in MS Visual C++ format.  

Programmers using compilers with different vtables must currently lay out 
OLE tables by hand.

In-process servers are implemented as DLLs loaded into the process' 
address space

Local servers are contacted using MS Lightweight RPC

More on Interfaces

All client/server communication starts with the IUnknown interface

New interfaces are discovered with the QueryInterface method of
IUnknown

This allows multiple interfaces to be supported via aggregation

OLE features

OLE has features similar to OpenDoc


 Scripting and automation support
 Data transfer via drag-and-drop, clipboard and linking (through change
advisories)
 Compound documents


In addition the storage architecture supports locked regions, and commit/revert
transactions (the product currently does not).

Monikers

Monikers are aliases for other objects, including:


 Files
 Items (within files)
 Anti monikers (which negate previous monikers)
 Pointers (to volatile storage)
 Composite (groups of monikers)


In OLE, nested data are handled with monikers

OLE Compound Documents


Container An application with some main purpose (e.g. Word) that
can contain servers
Server A smaller program that is either loaded into the address space
or through LRPC that allows editing of some sub-document


Pixelmaps of sub-documents are cached to allow document display without 
full server activation.

OCXs

OCXs or ``OLE Custom Controls'' are Microsoft's replacement for Visual Basic 
controls, and are more generally applicable to OLE.  

Their purpose is to provide a standard architecture for most servers.

Each consists of an in-process server aggregated with an automation server
(which allows scripting).  

Biggest weakness: OCXs cannot be containers.

CORBA overview: The Common Object Request Broker Architecture

Distributed Objects:  Distributed computing with object-oriented principles

CORBA objects can exist anywhere on a network

Their location is transparent to other objects

The Object Request Broker (ORB) marshals communication between objects

Object interfaces are defined in a PL-independent Interface Definition Language
(IDL)

CORBA History

CORBA spec is controlled by the Object Management Group (OMG), a consortium
of over 500 companies

CORBA 1.0 was published in 1990 and specified the compliant behaviors of
individual ORBs

CORBA 2.0 was published in 1996 and specified interoperability between ORBs,
as well as updating other aspects of the spec

Five sub-specifications on different standardized services ORBs must 
implement have been issued.  Three exist in RFC form.

Interface Definition Language

The IDL completely specifies communication between a client and server

The client/server relationship is arbitrary, and is generally linked to 
the initiating object

The IDL defines:


Modules: sets of class descriptions grouped into one namespace
Interfaces: sets of method invocations.  Like a class definition with
no implementation
Operations: the CORBA term for methods
Data types: include simple types short, long, unsigned short, unsigned long, 
float, double, char, boolean, and octet, and constructed types enum, string,
struct, array, union, sequence and ``any.''  Aggregate types can be 
constructed with typedefs


IDL example

module MyAnimals
{
  interface Dog: Pet, Animal
  {
    attribute integer age;
    exception NotInterested (string explanation);

    void Bark(in short how_long)
      raises (NotInterested);

    void Sit(in string where)
      raises (NotInterested);
  }
}

Attributes provide automatic get/set operations.

Object Request Brokers

ORBs are also called ``object buses''  

All requests to other objects go through the ORB

An ORB is not a single process or a set of processes, it is a set of services
and protocols

ORBs can be compared with plumbing

ORBs: Client side


Client IDL stubs which pack up information and transport it to the
server, and are created by the IDL compiler
Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII) which allows run-time binding of 
object interfaces
Interface Repository APIs are stored in a run-time database, allowing
the DII to discover object methods
ORB Interface which provides a few commonly needed services, such as
converting object reference objects to strings


ORBs: Server side


Server IDL stubs  created by the IDL compiler
Dynamic Skeleton Interface (DSI) is the server-equivalent of the DII,
allowing it to receive non IDL-marshaled requests
Object Adapter provides a runtime environment for CORBA objects, 
including assigning IDs (object references), instantiation, and message 
passing
Implementation Repository provides a place to store administrative
data, including the location of executable servers
ORB Interface provides a few commonly needed services (same as 
client side)


Steps in creating a CORBA service


 Create your IDL definitions
 Precompile to create interface skeletons
 Add server implementation code
 Compile 


The compile will add APIs to the Interface Repository, create client IDL
stubs and executable server objects, and register the executable with the
Implementation Repository

When a client opens a connection to the server, the Object Adapter will 
check the Implementation Repository for a compatible executable, and 
instantiate it

Dynamic Invocations

To allow interface discovery, a client can dynamically invoke object methods
with the DII

The steps are:


 Obtain the method description
 Create argument list
 Create the request
 Invoke the method using RPC, Send/Receive, or Datagram, depending on
the method description


Library routines are provided to aid in this process

More on Object Adapters

Object Adapters

 Registers server classes with the IR
 Instantiates new objects
 Manages object references
 Broadcasts the presence of object servers
 Handles incoming client calls


The OA is effectively an inherited interface, although it can be implemented
in procedural languages

Standardized Basic Object Adapters (BOAs) are provided for the common
cases:  shared server, unshared server, server-per-method, and persistent
server

Common Object Service Specifications

A number of standardized services have been established, and more are being 
worked on.  These are grouped together in Common Object Service Specifications
(COSSs)


COSS1: Life Cycle, Naming, Persistence, Event Notification (1993)
COSS2: Transactions, Concurrency Relationships, Externalization (1994)
COSS3: Security, Time (1995)
COSS4: Query, Licensing, Properties (1995)
COSS5: Trader, Collections Change Management (1996)


I will discuss some of these in the following slides

Naming, Events, Life Cycle and Trader


Naming: A standardized hierarchical name service designed to 
encapsulate other services such as DCE CDS, ISO X.500, and Sun NIS+
Trader: Provides a way of finding the object most suited to a
task based on some set of criteria
Life Cycle: Allows the creation, copying, deleting, and moving of
objects.  Also allows relationships between objects to be defined in terms
of graphs
Events: Allows semantic level events to be defined and distributed


Transactions and Concurrency

The Transaction Object allows nested Commit/Abort style transaction to be
defined. The object interface is inherited by objects that support transactions

The Concurrency service includes locking facilities to allow mutual exclusion
and synchronization

Persistence and Object Databases

The Persistence object allows seamless access to one or two level stores

The implementation is complex, but three basic interfaces are provided:


 The Direct Access (DA) protocol provides direct access to 
persistent data using a Data Definition Language
 The ODMG-93 protocol provides access to object from C++ using
ODMG's DDL
 The Dynamic Data Object protocol is used to define a structure
that contains all the data for an object


The latter can be used for two-level stores such as relational databases
and filesystems

Notes on CORBA

ORBs from different vendors are only compatible if they implement half-bridges
to a reference protocol that runs on top of TCP/IP (CORBA 2.0)

ORB vendors have great flexibility in determining transport, packaging, and
server calling mechanisms

The flexibility is intended to encourage high performance systems

Performance varies widely by implementation and relative object location

Interesting Issues


 Parallelism

 Breaking applications into smaller objects that cooperate increases
potential parallelism
 Objects designed to work across networks will be forced to exploit
concurrency to avoid excessive blocking

 Programming Languages

 The smaller size of objects encourages inter-procedural analysis
 All new languages can use existing object components
