 Program 3 


  Program 3  


 CS302 Section 12
 TA: Michael Birk
 Assigned: Tue 10/1/96
 Due: Tue 10/8/96



For program 3, you will write a simple version of the game Hangman. 
In this game, you try to guess a "secret" word or phrase one letter at a
time.  If you guess all the letters to the word before making a certain
number of mistakes, you win.

 What to Do 

For this assignment, you will need to combine the C++ code that you write
with some C++ code provided by your instructor.  This provided code consists
of two parts:



 The string class, which allows you to easily create and
       manipulate string objects.
   Two functions, described below.



In order to use these provided files, you will link them with your
source code.  This means that several C++ source code files are combined
into a single executable.  Even in programs 1 and 2, your source code was
linked with the standard library, enabling you to, for example, print to the
screen.



The exact steps involved in setting up this linking process depend on the
compiler and environment you are using:



 The Vectra Lab
 Borland C++ Outside of the Vectra Lab
 Using GNU g++
 Any Other Environment


 The Vectra Lab 


If you are doing all of your work in the lab, then use the following steps. 
Remember to ask a consultant if you have trouble with these
instructions.


 Run Borland C++
   Create a "project file" by choosing "Project/New" from the menu.
       This brings up a window prompting you for the name of the project.
       Erase whatever is there and type prog3 (no "dot" or three-letter
       extension).  Also, make sure that "EasyWin" (and not "Application") is
       selected from the list below.  Then, click on the "Advanced" button,
       which brings up yet another window.  Here, remove the checkmark by
       the ".rc file" and ".def file" lines.  Then click "OK" twice (once 
       for the "Advanced" window, and again in the "New Target" window).
   Add the files for the string class and the functions to
       your project.  To do this, first click on the line "prog3 [.exe]"
       in the "Project Window."  It should now be highlighted.  Then hit
       the "Insert" key and type in the file name:
       "r:\public\mbirk\string.obj".  (Do not enter the quotation marks.)
       Now, click on the "prog3 [.exe]" line
       again, hit the "Insert" key, and type:
       "r:\public\mbirk\prog3fun.obj".  Make sure you type these exactly as
       shown.  When you are done, the "prog3 [.exe]" line should have three
       files "hanging" from it: "prog3func [.obj]", "string [.obj]", and
       "prog3 [.cpp]".
   Double-click on the "prog3 [.cpp]" line to bring up a blank editor
       window.  In this window, type in the following test program:



#include <iostream.h>
#include "r:\public\mbirk\string.h"

string random_secret_phrase ();
bool char_in_string (char ch, string string);

int main ()
{
   cout << random_secret_phrase() << endl;
   return 0; 
}



When you run this program, it should print a single, "random" phrase and
quit.  You can now use this program as a "shell" or "template" for the
hangman program.


Note: The next time you run Borland C++ in order to work on Program 3, you will need
to a "Project/Open", not a "File/Open."  Then select "prog3.ide" from the file
selection window.

  Borland C++ Outside of the Vectra Lab 


If you are using Borland C++ at home or some other site than the Vectra Lab,
then read the instructions above.  They are correct,
except that you cannot access the files on the r: drive.  Instead,
you will have to download the ".cpp" and ".h" files
(note that the "Makefile" and "CVS" directory won't be used) and save them
in your working directory.  (Note that these files are source files
ending in ".cpp" and ".h" instead of object files ending in ".obj" -
that's ok.) Then, when creating the project, eliminate the prefix
"r:\public\mbirk" and replace all of the ".obj" suffixes with ".cpp".



Note: If you are using Borland C++ 5.0, there is a minor incompatibilty. 
Edit the "defs.h" file, and remove (or "comment out") all lines with the
word "bool".  This is because 5.0 has the bool type built-in, but
4.5 does not.


 Using GNU g++ 


The process for using g++ is very different.  First, you need to download the source files.  Download all six files
(ignore the "CVS" directory).  Then, test these files by typing "make" in
the directory which contains them.  It should compile the program to an
executable "prog3". Test it by typing "./prog3" - it will print a single
"secret phrase" and exit.  Now you can use "prog3.cpp" as a basis for the
assignment; each time you want to compile it, type "make".


 Any Other Environment 


If you are using any other environment, such as Microsoft Visual C++ or
Turbo C++, you may need to do some extra work.  This is because I don't have
access to these environments, so I can't test them out.  You can try the
following:  download the source files.  Consult
your instructions on how to set up a projectt, and add the three ".cpp"
files to this project.  You may need to modify the "defs.h" file.  If you
can't get it to work, ask me.  If you still can't get it to work, you will
have to do it in the Vectra Lab.

 Using the string Class 

The string class allows you to treat strings (sequences of
characters) like built-in types, even though they're not.  String literal
constants are in quotes, and you can define string variables, assign one
string to another, print strings to the screen, etc.  For example:



      string first_name = "John";
      string last_name  = "Doe";
      cout << "Hello, " << first_name << " " << last_name << "!\n";



In addition, you can "add" two strings together with the +
operator.  This is called concatenation:



      string name = first_name + " " + last_name;
      cout << name << endl;       // prints "John Doe"
      name += ", Jr.";            // same as name = name + ", Jr."
      cout << name << endl;       // prints "John Doe, Jr."



To find out how long a string is, use the length member function. 
For example:



       string name;
       cout << "What is your name? ";
       cin >> name;
       cout << "Your name is " << name.length() << " characters long!\n";



You can also access individual characters of the string using the square
brackets.  Inside the brackets, put an integer expression that evaluates to
the index of the character you are interested in.  These indices
start at 0, not 1.  E.g.:



      string test = "Test";
      cout << test [0] <<    // prints "T"
      char ch = test [2];    // ch = 's'



To access all of the characters in a string, use the square brackets inside
of a loop.  For this you need to know how long the string is; use the
length member function for this.  Also, note that you can modifiy
the characters of a string using the brackets.  For example, to convert a
string to all uppercase, you could do the following:



      for (int i = 0; i < some_string.length(); i++)
         some_string [i] = toupper( some_string[i] );


 Using the Provided Functions 


In order to hone your function-calling expertise, I am providing you with
two functions that you must use for program 3.  These functions are the
following:



 string random_secret_phrase (); 
       Returns a string that is a"random" secret phrase to use in the
       hangman game.  Note that his function has no parameters (inputs),
       just a return value (output).
   bool char_in_string (char ch, string string); 
       Returns true if the character ch is in the
       string, false otherwise.



For example, char_in_string ('x', "xyz") returns true,
which char_in_string ('h', "Hello!") returns false.

 What To Hand In 

As always, hand in a printed copy of both your source code and the output
displayed when the program is run.  For the output, you should run the
program three times and hand in the printed output for all three. 
At least on run should show you correctly guessing the secret phrase, and
another should show you running out of chances.

Note: don't forget to have your program print your name and section
number, so that they show up on all of your printouts!

 Sample Program Output 

Here are some sample program outputs.  Note a few things:



 Only letters are guessed; spaces and punctuation come "for free."
   The program checks for errors on input; characters which aren't
       letters aren't allowed.  Also, you can't guess the same letter twice.
   You only lose one of your five "chances" if you guess an incorrect
       letter (that you haven't guessed before).
   Upper-case and lower-case letters are not distinguished; guessing
       a capital 'A', for instance, matches all lower-case 'a' letters
       in the secret phrase.
   The program plays one game of hangman and then quits.
   To print a double-quotation mark in your program,
       precede the double-quote with a backslash inside of a string
       literal constant.  E.g.: 
cout << "My name is \"mud\"!\n";
