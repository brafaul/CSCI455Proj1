Research Summary


 Research Experience


University of Utah, Physics Department: 
Advisor: Eugene Loh, Cosmic Ray Research Group

Summer '91
      Designed, built, and tested a model system of optical fibers
	to be implemented as a part of the mirror calibration system of the 
	HiRes Fly's Eye currently being built.
	Co-worker: Zhen Liu
   Summer '92
      Designed, built, and constructed a "moon scope" - a portable
	calibrated instrument that would allow a comparison of the 
	atmosphere's ability to transmit light at different sites using a 
	common light source (the moon).


Lewis and Clark College, Physics Department:
Advisor: Herschel Snodgrass

6/93 - 7/94
      Programmed data analysis routines and analyzed data from 
	solar magnetograms in research that lead to my senior thesis
	in physics.

Astronautics Department: 
Advisor: Janice Downer

 Summer '95
      Explored numerical methods of optimizing vibration control in 
	flexible beams undergoing large slewing motions.
