Tobacco Free Wisconsin Coalition

Background

The Tobacco Free Wisconsin Coalition is a group of more than 100 statewide organizations and
local tobacco free coalitions working to reduce tobacco use in the state of Wisconsin.  The goals
of the Coalition are to:


    Promote policies which reduce the promotion, sales, distribution to and use of tobacco by minors
    Promote policies which protect the health of non-smokers
    Increase activities and encourage services to prevent tobacco use and help current smokers quit
    Conduct events and use the mass media to promote tobacco control and smoking cessation
    Educate community leaders about the benefits of using public health policy to combat smoking


The Tobacco Free Wisconsin Coalition was organized in 1990 to coordinate a comprehensive
tobacco control program in Wisconsin.  The Coalition meets twice yearly for educational and
business purposes. Coalition working committees are actively involved in projects related to the
media, worksites, public policy, strategic planning and education.


Membership

Tobacco Free Wisconsin Coalition membership is open to any organization or individual who is
involved or interested in tobacco control. Membership is $50 per year.  Meetings are held twice a
year in locations throughout the state.
