Program 5

Objective: Give the student practice with switch
statements and for loops.
Program Description


You've been asked by a group of school teachers to help their geometry
classes learn shapes.  They want to reinforce the ideas of different
shapes to their students.  To accomplish this, they would like a
program that displays a number of different shapes and that allows the
students to enter the size of the shape as well.  Each shape is to be
printed to the screen using '*' characters, and should be completely
filled in.  Listed below is a description of how they would like the
program to run, as well as some examples of the different shapes.  

Your program should have two layers of menus, all implemented with a
switch statement.  The main menu consists of
a request for either a 4-sided shape menu, a 3-sided shape menu, or to
quit.  The second layer of menus consists of the two separate shape
menus.  
      

The 4-sided shape menu should present 5 choices: draw
one of four 4-sided shapes (square, rectangle, parallelogram, diamond)
or to return back to the main menu.

 A square is a 4-sided shape that has a height the same length
as its width with right angles between adjacent sides.

A rectangle is a 4-sided shape that may have different lengths for
the height and width, but still has right angles between adjacent
sides.

A parallelogram is a 4-sided shape with opposite sides parallel
and of equal length.  For this assignment, we are assuming that the
requested parallelograms have angles of 45 and 135 degrees only.

A diamond is represented as a 4-sided shape with each side equal
in length with the corners pointing up/down and left/right.



The following are examples of the four 4-sided shapes:


*****      *******          ********        *
*****      *******         ********        ***
*****      *******        ********        *****
*****      *******       ********          ***
*****      *******      ********            *


Each shape is respectively, a square with sides of length 5, a
rectangle with sides of height 5 and width 7, a parallelogram with
height 5 and width 8, and a diamond with sides of length 3.  

After a shape is selected, your program should request for the lengths
of the shapes sides.  Note that some shapes require only one length
(square and diamond) and others require two lengths.  

The 3-sided shape menu should present 5 choices: draw
one of four 3-sided shapes (all of which are right isosceles
triangles) or to return back to the main menu.


A right isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length joined at a right angle.


The following are examples of the four 3-sided shapes:


    *      *          *****      *****
   **      **         ****        ****
  ***      ***        ***          ***
 ****      ****       **            **
*****      *****      *              *


Notice that these are examples of the four types of triangles each
with sides of length 5.  In addition, we can name the types by where
the right angle is in relation to the triangle.  Above we have
lower-right, lower-left, upper-left, and upper-right triangles,
respectively.  

After a shape is selected, your program should request the length of
the triangle's sides.  Note that the length is that belonging to the
sides of equal length, so only one length is needed.  

The drawing of all shapes (3 and 4-sided) should be implemented using
for loops. Each of the eight shapes should have a
corresponding function (e.g. void draw_diamond(int length);
.)  However, the body of a function may include a call to another
function; you might want to consider doing this for similar shapes.


Once the shape has been drawn, the program should remain at the
current shape menu, for requesting of additional shapes.  

The following error checks must be implemented to receive full credit:

Any improper responses during menu selection should result in the user being notified and the menu being presented again.
Valid lengths for all shapes are integer values between 1 and 15 inclusive.

What To Turn In
Once you have your program working you should:

Print out a copy of each of the eight possible shapes.
Print out a copy of your C++ source code.  
Submit an electronic copy of your source code and
executable as described in the project 1 directions.
