 NOTE: This should go without saying but... All opinions expressed in
this page are my own (and they aren't really my opinions, just my brand of
humor) and not those of the University of Wisconsin, or anyone else for that

Also, note that although I'm picking on these songs, I really like all of
them and the artists who, uh, ripped me off.  This is my own little way
of paying tribute to them.  So don't get all defensive if I'm picking on
your favorite artist or song.  I'm teasing them because I like them.

CD Information

 "They Stole These From Me" is a greatest hits
	compilation.
   Contains a few new tracks, just so I can make more money off the people
	who already have all my albums.
   Available soon at all fine record outlets.
   These are all originals,  I swear.  They stole them from me.
   They stole them from me.
   They stole them from me.
   They stole them from me.
   But I'm NOT bitter.


Sound Clips and Lyrics
PARENTAL ADVISORY: The sound clips may contain offensive language.
If you are under 18 years of age, ask your mommy for permission before
downloading these clips.  O.K.  Enough covering my ass.  Let's get to it.

The sound clips are HUGE files.  I will be putting smaller demo clips here soon.  Also, I will make some of them available as WAV files.


 Ring My Bell
 One (opera version)
 Justify My Love
 Binge And Purge
 More Coming SOON!!!


Apologies

 I apologize if I offend anyone or cause anyone to be nauseated, go
  insane, shatter their eardrums due to excessive dissonance, or lose sleep because one of my catchy tunes is repeating over and over
  and over and over in their head night and day. (Please see Disclaimer above).
   To all the artists who ripped off my songs:  I'm sorry, but your
  versions suck compared to my awesome originals.
   I apologize for the sorta poor sound quality (at least on my little
  sparc 10 speaker it sounds sorta crappy).  It sounds much better on the
  original tape, played on my speakers at home.  Something was lost in the
  transition.  Yeah, that's it...
   I apologize for the simplicity of most drum tracks.  I know they are
  boring.  I just didn't have the time or patience to make them complex.
   I apologize for my lack of skill on the guitar.  Give me a break. I
  picked it up a couple of years ago and only play it once in a blue moon.  Then again,
  since these songs are supposed to be humorous I guess they should sound bad.


Sound Equipment

 No synthesizers where used in the making of this recording.
   Drums where programmed or played on a Yamaha RX something or other.
   Jerel plays an Ibanez RG570 guitar.
   Jerel uses a Boss ME10 for all sound processing.
   All these recordings where made/mixed on a Yamaha something or other
  4 track at Jerel's home studio, which is why they are such high quality and
  you can hear the freeway in the background.


Lot's More Good Crap

 Coming SOON!!!
