Using Vista


Getting Started with Vista



   
Before using Vista add
/p/vision/ip-tools/vista/bin

to your path variable (in .cshrc or .cshrc.local), and do:
setenv MANPATH /usr/man/sunos-4.1.3-overlay:/p/vision/ip-tools/vista/man

to make the man pages available.

Next, read the two man pages: Vista(7Vi) and Vtutorial(7Vi) (simply do a
man Vista and man Vtutorial.  If in doubt, look at the directory
/p/vision/ip-tools/vista/man/man7).  There will
be a document, Introduction to Vista Programming, available at
DOIT Documentation.  
Try out the examples given in Vtutorial.

There are a few basic operations to learn right away:

Display an image
    Examples may be found in /p/vision/ip-tools/vista/src/data. 
    Vista files have .v extensions.  To display an image, use
    vxview filename.  Try to convert your own image into a .v
    file by using tifftopnm and pnmtov.
Create an image
    The directory /p/vision/ip-tools/vista/src/examples/ramp has
    a sample program which does just that.  The Intro to Vista document
    mentioned above explains how to read this program.
Open an existing image and access its contents
    The binarize directory in the same src directory has a simple
    program to do that.  Read the intro document.
Print an image
    Pipe the results of the votps program on an image to 
    your favorite postscript printer: 
vtops einstein.v | lpr -Plaser1
