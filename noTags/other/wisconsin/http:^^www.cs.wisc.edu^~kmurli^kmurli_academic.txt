Hi, 
 About myself,  

I am currently doing my graduate work in  Computer Sciences  and would be graduating by December this year. My interests are in Databases and in Networks. I would love to have a challenging job in which I can learn something new! 
 My ambition.. 

My dream is to be part of some project which I can be proud of. My aim is to attain satisfaction by taking part in the design and development of a project which would be really useful to mankind.
 The official document.. ( Resume )
My  RESUME  is available here in  ASCII  and in  Postscript   versions. 


 My past..	

My undergrad degree in B.E.(Computer Science & Engineering) was from  CEG  - College of Engineering , Guindy,located in   Chennai (Madras)  ,  India  , that has been there for 200 years.
 The present..

I have taken up some interesting courses out here in Madison.

Please follow this link to get a detailed listing of the course structure and what I did in those courses..

Database courses:



CS 564- Design and implementation of Databases 
CS 764- Topics in Database Management systems 
CS 799- Independent study under Raghu Ramakrishnan 

Network courses: 



CS 640- Networks 
CS 740- Advanced Networks 

 Architecture course: 



CS 752- Advanced Architecture

 Operating Systems course: 



CS 736- Advanced Operating Systems

 Performance Evealuation


CS 737- Performance Evaluation and modelling


 Projects.. 

I have done a couple of them here.. Please follow the links in each of them to get a detailed information on what I did in those..


 The DEVise project.. 
 This is the one that I am doing as an independent study.

 The Sequence ADT implementation:
This is implementation of a sequence abstract data type in Paradise a Geographic Information system.

 ATM and FTP implementation: 
This involoved designing and developing a reliable ATM network over UDP and writing a FTP server/clent over it.

 Predicting Future with History.. 
This was done as part of the Architecture course. This involved designing and simulation studies of load predicting caches.

 Implementation of B+Trees and Heap files.
As part of the 564 course was involved in a serires of assignments in developing B+Trees, Heap Files and others..


 The rest of the page is still under construction. Sorry!
