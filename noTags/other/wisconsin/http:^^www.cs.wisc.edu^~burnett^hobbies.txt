  Dave just wants to...  


Books
Currently reading: Liar's Poker - Michael Lewis
  Last 3 books finished:

A Month of Sundays - John Updike
    Borderlands 3 - Horror Compilation
    Cold Snap - Thom Jones


    Next on the shelf: Return of the Native - Thomas Hardy

    My reading list.
Melanie and I both made a list of 100 books we would like to read.
    It should take her only a few years, but I suspect 10+ years for me 
    (they'll have to compete with 100 CS books/journals, not to mention countless horror
    anthologies.)
I am grateful for both Joe & Cathy's recommendations,
   as well as 
   The Professor's Guilt List.  I concede that most of the authors are
   white and/or male; perhaps I'll be more exploratory with the next 100.
