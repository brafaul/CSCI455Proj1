m-files from the text book


m-files from the text book (as of 14oct) 

The file message in the  m-files directory 
is a self-unwrapping wrapper that, when executed in a unix environment, will
create the nine Chapter directories and all their content (saving you the
trouble of copying all those m-files one by one).

The files  
 spline.m,
 mkpp.m,
 unmkpp.m,
 ppval.m 
 in the
 m-files directory 
 are enhanced versions of matlab's m-files by that name.
