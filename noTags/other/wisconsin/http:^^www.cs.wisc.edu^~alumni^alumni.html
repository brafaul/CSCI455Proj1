 The UW-Madison Computer Sciences Dept. Alumni Group





 The Computer Sciences Alumni Group 

This WWW home page contains relevant information for our alumni.  The
UW-CS Alumni Group was launched in 1993 in order to encourage a strong
connection between past and present members of our department.
Currently the department supports:

 The Alumni Directory (published annually). 
 This printed directory
contains address and employment information for those alumni who
choose to share this information.
 The Alumni Newsletter, Badger Bytes (published twice a year).
 This printed newsletter reports news both about our department 
and our alumni.
 The Alumni Email List.
 We use our email list to announce job postings
and other items of general interest to UW-CS alums.  To submit an item
for the Alumni Email List, email alumni@cs.wisc.edu.
