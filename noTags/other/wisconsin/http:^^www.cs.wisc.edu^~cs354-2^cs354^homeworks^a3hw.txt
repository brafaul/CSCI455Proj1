Total score:
(1) (4 points) Find the largest IEEE 32 bit
floating point number that does not have an integer value. Express
the answer in binary and in decimal.
 
 
 
 
 
(2) (2 points each, 6 points total) Write
the hexadecimal values for x, y and z just after the following code
executes:
move x, 0x0f0fc123
and  x, x, 0xff00f000      # x = ?
not  x, x                  # x = ?
move y, 0x8f0aabc9
sll  y, y, 5               # y = ?
nor  z, x, y               # z = ?
 
 
(3) (3 points each, 6 points total) Do the
following 2's complement multiplication. Indicate if either
computation overflows for 12 bit words, for 6 bit words. Show your
work. Check your results by redoing the computation in
decimal.
  
  001010                                   001010
x 111100                                 x 000011
--------                                 --------

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4) (4 points) Show that the following two
code segments give the same value for c, for any values of a and b.
Hint: consider truth tables (see page 116 of the text).


     and c, a, b                                 not c, a
     not c                                       not d, b
                                                 or  c, c, d
