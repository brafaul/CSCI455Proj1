Welcome to
 GRADES  for CS 132 
 
 Grades for section 305  1:20-2:10 MWF 
 Grades for section 310  4:00-5:15 TR 
 


Sorry it took me longer than I thought to grade the midterms.     
It was out of 89 points.  The average for my classes was 63.7/89. 
This comes out to about 71.6%. From what I've heard its consistent with 
the other labs. I wrote in your score out of 89. So to get your percentage 
score divide by 89. If you have any questions or complaints e-mail me!!  

The grades aren't in any particular order so you'll just have to look through
the list to find the last 4 digits of your student ID.
If you are in one of my labs and aren't on either of these lists e-mail me at 
jherro@cs.wisc.edu.  Everyone should 
be there now.  If you notice any other mistakes with 
the grades please let me know.  
Lab1a and b were each worth 50 points. They were both all or nothing. So if I 
didn't get e-mail from you then you got 0. 
Lab 2 was out of 100 
The lab on WWW was all or nothing. I don't know how much it will count so I 
just put an "x" if i recieved mail from you. 
Lab3a and b were both out of 100. 
Lab4a was out of 100. 
Lab4b was out of 110
