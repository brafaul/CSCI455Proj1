Hi Everyone!

   I am Snowy. I belong to the species of owls called snowy :-). My photograph
   has finally arrived! Here it is...

   I am a night owl. Well, actually I 
   think all owls are night owls but I thought I should tell you. I live
   on Shilpa's desk. We are good friends and give each other good company 
   especially when either of us is lonely. Well, Shilpa is always banging 
   away on her keyboard so I am often alone at home. Anyway, if you send 
   me mail I will sure get it. So please do send me mail. I dont have my
   own email address yet as I am not in school but Shilpa promised me that
   she will get one for me soon. Well, she is lazy I tell you. I have been
   really hammering on her head to make a homepage for me. Looks like she
   remembered today. 



   I am an avid net surfer. Here is my list of interesting links.

And finally an appeal : Many of my brothers and sisters, owls and otherwise
have been put on the endangered species list because some of you kill us for
our colorful feathers, stuffed animals, meat or pure pleasure. Please remember 
that for every stuffed snowy (Note : I am not a stuffed owl, I am REAL),
there was a real one, very much alive. We also have a right to our lives so 
let us live in harmony :-). 



Send mail to Snowy.
