TETRA: A Multi-platform Instruction Trace Analyzer



TETRA: A Multi-platform Instruction Trace Analyzer



What is TETRA?


TETRA is a tool for evaluating serial program performance under the
resource and control constraints of fine-grain parallel processors.
TETRA was written by Todd Austin
(austin@cs.wisc.edu).  TETRA's primary advantage to the user is its
ability to quickly generate performance metrics for yet to be designed
architectures.  All the user needs to specify is the capabilities of
the architecture (e.g., number of functional units, issue model,
etc.), rather than its implementation.

TETRA has many options to parameterize the data, control and resource
constraints placed on the execution graph it constructs, including
control over the execution model's:

 memory disambiguation capability
 control model (based either on the CFG or the CDG)
 branch prediction mechanism (e.g., fixed, taken, 2-bit BTB)
 functional unit supply and latencies
 window size (e.g., total reservation stations)
 renaming capability (register or memory)


When constructing execution graphs with limited resources, TETRA
provides five user selectable schedulers, varying in cost,
performance, and capability:

 HISTORY scheduler (simulates on-line the capability of an off-line LIST scheduler)
 LIST BEST-FIT scheduler
 LIST FIRST-FIT scheduler
 ROUND-ROBIN scheduler
 RANDOM scheduler


In addition, TETRA provides a number of options describing the
analyses performed on the constructed execution graph, including
generation of:

 parallelism profiles
 value sharing distributions
 storage demand profiles
 value lifetime distributions
 disassembled (parallel) instruction traces


The software is very modular, allowing it to be easily used as a test
bed for new ideas.  TETRA is currently only targeted for MIPS- and
SPARC-based systems, but porting it to other architectures supported
by QPT (or
another capable tracer) requires very little coding (just a few
constants and an instruction dependency decoder).  There are two
papers describing the development and application of TETRA, the
references are in the manual page (and also available on the Web
page).

Even if you're not interested in the amount of parallelism in serial
programs, you may still find TETRA useful if you do or are planning to
do trace analysis, especially with QPT.  Included in
the source package are useful goodies including: instruction decoders,
disassemblers, and dependency analyzers with machine-independent
interfaces (for the MIPS and SPARC architectures), a QPT trace
generator, a QPT trace decoder,
a GNUPLOT compatible distribution generator, and a portable fixed size
heap allocator.


System requirements:


You'll need the following to install TETRA:

 a SPARC- or MIPS-based unix system
 an ANSI C compiler (preferably GNU GCC)
 QPT, program profiler and tracing system written by James Larus
 GNU BFD library built for the host architecture
 GNU LIBERTY library


TETRA has been tested on the following configurations:

 SPARC/SunOS 4.1.3/GNU GCC 2.6.3 (primary testing configuration)
 SPARC/SunOS 4.1.3/Sun ACC 1.0
 MIPS/Ultrix 4.3/GNU GCC 2.6.3
 MIPS/Ultrix 4.3/MIPS CC version 3.0



How do I get TETRA?


The source release for TETRA version 2.0.0 is available via anonymous
ftp at "ftp.cs.wisc.edu" in the file "/sohi/Code/tetra-2.0.0.tar.Z".
(Clicking on the highlighted file name will fetch the file to your machine.)


How can I learn more about TETRA?


There is a manual page included in the source distribution, which
includes installation and user's instructions.  In addition, there are
two papers describing the implementation and application of TETRA.

Who made TETRA?


TETRA is the result of research conducted by
Todd Austin
and
Guri Sohi
of the
Wisconsin Multiscalar Group
at the
University of Wisconsin - Madison.
TETRA was written by
Todd Austin
(austin@cs.wisc.edu).  Portions of the code were written and/or
copyrighted by
Alain KÃ¤gi
(author of the Fibonacci heap code) and The
Regents of the University of California (developer the AVL tree code).
The development of this code was supported by grants from the National
Science Foundation (grant CCR-9303030 plus software capitalization
supplement) and the Office of Naval Research (grant N00014-93-1-0465).
