CS 302 Fall 1996 - Section 2 Programs
What to hand in:

A printed copy of your program needs to be handed in (see Late Policy).

An electronic copy must also be submitted.  This can be done by copying 
your source file to the directory: 
r:\handin\dzimm\Your_Account_Name
You may submit as many times as you like by simply overwriting the file 
already there.  I recommend that you submit early and often.

I would also like you to put your name, login ID, program number, and the 
due date at the top of each program.  Remember to comment it out or you will 
get strange syntax errors.
