      it does have a cool picture of fruit fly genes)
  
      Microbial Diversity Image Database (not much here, although
      you can jump over the microbiology department for some 
      snappy DNA visualization pictures)
  
      Database Sea Floor Image Database System (an interesting page,
      but no image database was on line.) (there are some nice earthquake
      pics in here too.)
  
      Prototype Library Image Database via Z39.50 Protocol (looks
      good, but I could never get the query to return any results.)
