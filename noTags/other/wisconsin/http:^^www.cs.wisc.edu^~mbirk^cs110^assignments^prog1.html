 Program 1 


  Program 1  


 CS110 Section 7
 TA: Michael Birk
 Assigned: Tue 9/10/96
 Due: Tue 9/17/96


In program 1 you will write a program to calculate Grade Point Average
(GPA).  You will ask the user to type in the number of classes in which they
received an A, AB, B, BC, C, D, and F, then print out the number of grade
points, the number of credits, and the GPA.  For this assignment assume all
classes are 3 credits.

The number of grade points earned for a class can be calculated
by multiplying the number of credits of the class by the grade
earned, using the following scale:


 A = 4.0
 AB = 3.5
 B = 3.0
 BC = 2.5
 C = 2.0
 D = 1.0
 F = 0.0


For example, a grade of AB in a 3 credit class would earn 3*3.5 = 10.5
grade points.  Note that in this system we'll count F's as credits - a F
should lower the GPA.

 What to Do 

 Part I: Creating the Program 

Run Borland C++ and create a new file in which to type in your source
code by choosing "File" and then "New" from the menu. (Or use the blank
window that's already there if there is one.)

Type in your program.  Start with this extremely simple program:
one which simply prints out your name and cs110 section number.

Then compile and run the program
by clicking on the small "lightning bolt" icon (or choose "Debug" and then
"Run" from the menu), as in program 0.  If you have any compiler errors,
a "Message" window will appear indicating the approximate line number
and reason for each error.  If you do not understand a particular compiler
error, ask a consultant for help.

Now extend the program by adding a few statements to it.  First add
the variable declarations to hold the various user inputs and the
cin statements.  Then compile and run the program to make
sure this part works.  Then add the part that performs the computation
and prints the results.  Run this program a few times, entering
different numbers and checking the results to make sure you don't have
a "bug."

 Part II: Using the Debugger

In this part, you will learn to use the Borland C++ debugger.
To use the debugger, press the F8 function keyboard (or choose
Debug/Next from the menu).  This will start executing your code
statement-by-statement.  Note how each time you press the F8
key, it executes the current statement.

Keep "walking" through your program with F8.  When you get to
a cin statement, the program will stop and wait for you to
type the input in the window.  After you type in the input, click on
that variable name in your program.  Then click the right mouse
button for a "pop up" menu.  In this menu choose Inspect.  This
brings up a window which shows you the value of that variable.  Use this
inspect feature to see how uninitialized variables have "garbage values."

You can use the debugger as many times as you like to investigate the
various aspects of your program.  (Note: there is nothing to hand in
for this part.)

 What to Hand In 

You will need to hand in a paper copy of your source code
and also the printed output.  To print the output, click on the system
menu box (the small horizontal bar) in the upper-left corener of the
window which has your program's output.  This brings up a menu - choose
"Print ..." from this menu.  Make sure that your program prints out
your name, etc. so that you know which printout is yours!

 Sample Program Output 


John Q. Doe's GPA Program
CS110 section 7  Program #1

Hello, this program will ask you for your grades and
then compute your GPA.  It assumes all your classes are
3 credits.

How many As did you get? 2
How many ABs did you get? 1
How many Bs did you get? 0
How many BCs did you get? 0
How many Cs did you get? 1
How many Ds did you get? 0
How many Fs did you get? 0

You have a total of 40.5 grade points with 12 credits,
for a GPA of 3.375
