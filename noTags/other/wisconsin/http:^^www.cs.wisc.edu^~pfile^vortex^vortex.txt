Vortex: Semi-custom hardware for a Typhoon prototype 


Vortex/Typhoon-Zero



Vortex is a standard-width MBUS board designed to work with a dual
hyperSparc processor module. It provides tag services on up to 128M of
physical memory, as well as a dispatch mechanism for message and
memory block access fault handler code.

When installed in each 
COW node, Vortex will
allow Tempest codes to run with hardware assisted block access
control/message dispatch, which allows memory to be shared on a
cache-line (32-byte) basis across nodes. The COW + Vortex is
referred to as Typhoon-Zero, and is intended as a prototype/feasibilty study for Typhoon, a more sophisticated hardware platform for Tempest codes. The
board does not implement any kind of DSM protocol; instead it provides
hardware assistance for the Tempest mechanisms, giving the user the
freedom to implement whatever policies are desired.


Here is a paper describing more than you ever wanted to know about Vortex:
