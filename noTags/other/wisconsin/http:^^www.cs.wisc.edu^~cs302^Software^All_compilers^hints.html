Hints for MS Windows Compilers


Our MS Windows-based Compilers
This page is under construction.
Open Output Files
When you are finished looking at the output files you have generated,
you should close the window.  Otherwise, when you attempt to run your
programs again the output file will be unchanged because your program will not
be allowed to write to a file while a window is open for a file.

After Running Your Program
When you are finished running your programs you should remember to close
the window that the program ran in.  If you leave a window
open with a running or inactive program it has different effects in the
C++ and Pascal compilers.  In both compilers it will not allow them to
run your programs.  In the C++ compiler, you can get around this by
choosing the build option under the project menu.
The best way to fix this is to bring up the task list
(CTRL-ESC) or left double click on the windows desktop.
Then you can select your programs (U:\PROG1.EXE, or
whatever name) and choose End Task.
