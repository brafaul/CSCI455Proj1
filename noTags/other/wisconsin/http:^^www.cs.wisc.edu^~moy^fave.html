Favorite Pages on the Web




Favorite Web Sites

Everybody has their favorite places to visit on
the Web, as do I. This page contains some of the sites I
frequently check out, so it serves exclusively as a launchpad to
other sites. Besides, it's easy to just dump a bunch of links on
a page!
 Fun


Yes, Dilbert
        receives a whopping huge link on my page. But I think
        it's well-deserved, as I visit the Dilbert page just
        about every day. I find the comic disturbingly hilarious.
A Beavis and
        Butthead site. I used to hate this show, but somehow,
        it became funny after a while. That first episode I
        watched must have killed more brain cells than I thought.

Computer Resources

 Intel Corporation.
        I own an Intel Pentium system, and besides, I interned
        there!
Microsoft.
        Microsoft has some great software available for
        downloading, and I refuse to bash Microsoft just for the
        sake of bashing Microsoft, as many people tend to.

 
Search Engines
