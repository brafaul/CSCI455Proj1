 Program 2 


  Program 2

In program 2, you are a computer programmer who has been hired by
a local restaurant to write a program for a new computer which will
replace an old cash register.  


 What to Do 

The restaurant only has four items on the menu.  You may pick what those
items are and set prices for them (each item must have a different price).
You need to keep a running total of what is ordered and loop until
the cash register operator asks the program to print out the total bill.
Also, you must keep track of how many of each item are purchased and
display them in the final bill.  Be creative with the name
of your restaurant, what sorts of food your restaurant offers, and what
the prices are (or, if you lack the imagination, you can use the menu
shown below).


Here is an example of what your menu might look like.  The formatting
does not need to be exactly like this, but all dollar amounts must be
formatted to 2 decimal places.


     The Hamburger Shack
     -------------------------------
     A.  Hamburger            $1.00
     B.  Cheeseburger         $1.20
     C.  Double Cheeseburger  $2.40
     D.  Bacon Cheeseburger   $2.00

     Q.  Quit adding items, and print the bill

	 Current Subtotal:  $0.00
	 Enter your selection -->


At this point, the cash register operator might press "A" (or, they
might press "a".  Your program should do the same thing either way).
You should add the cost of item A to the running subtotal and
redisplay the menu with the updated subtotal:


     Enter your selection --> A

     New subtotal is $1.00

     The Hamburger Shack
     -------------------------------
     A.  Hamburger            $1.00
     B.  Cheeseburger         $1.20
     C.  Double Cheeseburger  $2.40
     D.  Bacon Cheeseburger   $2.00

     Q.  Quit adding items, and print the bill

     Current Subtotal: $1.00
     Enter your selection --> 


When the operator chooses "Q" from the menu, 
your program should print out an itemized list of what
was ordered (and the total cost for each item), the subtotal, the
sales tax (use 5% for sales tax), and the total (subtotal +
sales tax).  For example:


     Enter your selection --> q

     Customer Bill
     -------------
     1 Hamburger            $1.00
     2 Cheeseburger         $2.40
     1 Bacon Cheeseburger   $2.00
                           ------
     Subtotal               $5.40
     Sales Tax              $0.27
                           ======
     Amount Due             $5.67


Notice that two cheeseburgers were ordered in this example, so the
cost is listed as 2 times $1.20, or $2.40.  Also notice that since
no double cheeseburgers were ordered, they are not mentioned on
the bill (it does not say "0 Double Cheeseburger").  The
program should stop executing after the final bill is printed.


What To Hand In

As in program 1, you will hand in a printed copy of both your source
code and the output displayed when the program is run.
The printed output should demonstrate all of the features of your program.
It should show ordering one of some item, ordering more than
one of another item, and not ordering any of a third item.  Also,
don't forget to have your program print your name and section number,
so that they show up on all of your printouts!
