Academic Misconduct



Academic Misconduct and CS302


Academic misconduct is a serious issue in a university, because
in part, the value of your degree lies in the standards of academic
honesty and integrity maintained by the university.  Also, as a
student you have the right to expect that you and other students
will be graded fairly, and thus you and your fellow students have
an obligation to conduct your academic work according to University
standards.

The Computer Sciences Department deals with academic misconduct in
a serious manner.  Academic misconduct encompasses the acts of:

presenting work as your own which is in part or in whole of
     someone else's authorship (be they a classmate, tutor, etc.),
 of giving your own work to another student,
 or of misrepresenting your work in some other way.

A simple rule of thumb is do not share code for assigned work in
any form.  So you should not look at anyone else's code, or 
allow someone else to look at your code.  In addition, don't discuss
program design with someone else to the extent that you are actually
discussing the code itself.  This is not intended to discourage
conversations about the assignments, or the course material. However
there is a big difference between talking with somebody about an
assignment, and sharing the code used to accomplish it.

It is also academic misconduct to misrepresent your own work in any
way, such as:

handing in a printout of a program that does not match the program
     submitted electronically,
 modifying your output in any way except those specified, or
 turning in output that was not created by running your program.

The usual sanction for academic misconduct is for the students
involved to be withdrawn from the course and explanatory letters to be
placed in their personal academic files.  At the very least, zeros are
recorded for the assignment in question.

Cheating is a distasteful subject to consider, and instances of
cheating cause disappointment for those involved.  It is something that
we try hard to avoid.  To this end, we want to make it clear that we will
work with you in gaining command of the course material.  If you are
falling behind, or are having difficulty completing an assignment, come
in to see your instructor during office hours.  Also, if you have any
questions about whether a particular practice is considered misconduct,
please talk with your instructor about it.
The Dean of Students Office has a brochure "Academic Misconduct Rules
and Procedures: Guide for Students".  This brochure will be handed out by
your instructor during the third week of class.
