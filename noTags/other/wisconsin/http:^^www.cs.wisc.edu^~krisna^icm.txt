Indian Classical Music



Why I am interested in Indian Classical Music

I am primarily interested in the mathematical and theoretical aspects
of Indian Classical music.  In particular, I am not interested
in the aesthetic, lyrical, religious, spiritual or social aspects of
music, dance or drama---however exciting or relevant they may be.

My knowledge of Indian music comes from reading books and listening to
the performances of the master (and the not-so-masterful) practitioners
of the art.  I occasionally post my brand of wisdom to the
Usenet newsgroup
rec.music.indian.classical.

Links to some of my (posted and unposted) articles (in an updated and
reformatted form) can be found below.  You should note that I (have at
least tried to) rigorously use my own
transliteration scheme for all Indian names and
terms.  It is unlikely that any material here will be useful to you
unless you are familiar with the transliteration.

I welcome comments, criticisms and suggestions, especially regarding
the contents of the articles.  Send all communication to
krishna@cs.wisc.edu.
