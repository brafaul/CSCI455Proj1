CS 302 Section 70 - Quiz 2


Quiz #2


Suppose we have a set S of n elements. Also, suppose we wish to put some of these elements into a list L. Our list L is a k-permutation of the set S if

a) L has size k
b) every element in L is distinct.

For example: S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. A 3-permutation of S is a 3 digit number where no two digits are the same (345 for example). 344, however, would not be a permutation, since the last two digits are the same.
The mathematical formula for the number of k-permutations when S is size n is

n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * (n-k+1)

a) Write a DO/END DO (not a WHILE loop) to calculate this number. Assume n and k are initialized already.

There are several ways to do it; here's one way:


ANSWER = 1
DO I = N, N-K+1 ,-1
   ANSWER = ANSWER*I
END DO

A different way is by counting up

ANSWER = 1
DO I=0,K-1
   ANSWER = ANSWER*(N-I)
END DO

Note that this goes to K-1 because (N-K+1) = (N-(K-1)), so I must start at
0 and end at K-1.


b) Write a DO WHILE/END DO loop to do the same. Make the same assumptions as in pt a).

I'll just do the parallel DO WHILE loop to the first example in pt a):


ANSWER = 1
I = N
DO WHILE(I .GE. N-K+1)
   ANSWER = ANSWER*I
   I = I-1
END DO



 What's wrong with these three code fragments? (Both problems are logicalerrors)
a)

        PRINT *,'Space Shuttle ready to launch'
	PRINT *,'Begin countdown at what number?'
	READ *,N
	DO I=N,1
	  PRINT *,'T minus',I
	END DO
	PRINT *,'BLASTOFF!'



Loop wants to count down, needs a -1 on the end
Should be DO I=N,1,-1

b)

	PRINT *,'When you were born, the President was '
	IF (AGE .GE. 4) THEN
	   PRINT *,'Bill Clinton'
	ELSE IF (AGE .GE. 8) THEN
	   PRINT *,'George Bush'
	ELSE IF (AGE .GE. 16) THEN
	   PRINT *,'Ronald Reagan'
	ELSE IF (AGE .GE. 20) THEN
	   PRINT *,'Jimmy Carter'
	ELSE IF (AGE .GE. 22) THEN
	   PRINT *,'Gerald Ford'
	ELSE IF (AGE .GE. 28) THEN
	   PRINT *,'Richard Nixon'
	ELSE
	   PRINT *,'Whew! Older than I am!'
	END IF




These should all be .LE.
Otherwise, for anyone older or equal to 4, (AGE .GE. 4) will be
.TRUE., so it'll always print Bill Clinton.

c)

	LOGICAL DONE
        DONE = .TRUE.
	DO WHILE(.NOT. DONE)
	   PRINT *,'Enter a zero'
	   READ *,A
	   IF (A .EQ. 0)
	     DONE = .TRUE.
	   ELSE
	     DONE = .FALSE.
             PRINT *,'You did not listen'
	   END IF
	END DO
	PRINT *,'Good, you entered a zero'




The loop will run only while .NOT. DONE is .TRUE., i.e. only while
DONE is .FALSE., so DONE must be set to .FALSE., not set to .TRUE., at
the top of the program.

Consider the following Subroutine:


C	Adds or subtracts 1 from value and reports
C	if operation was carried out
	SUBROUTINE ADDSUB1(OPER,VALUE,DONE)

	CHARACTER*3 OPER
	INTEGER VALUE
	LOGICAL DONE

	IF (OPER .EQ. 'ADD') THEN
		VALUE = VALUE + 1
		DONE = .TRUE.
	ELSE IF (OPER .EQ. 'SUB') THEN
		VALUE = VALUE - 1
		DONE = .TRUE.
	ELSE
		DONE = .FALSE.
	END IF
	
	RETURN
	END


Which arguments are
a) Input arguments only 

OPER
OPER is used by the function, but not assigned to. So the value from the main program is used, hence it is an input argument.

b) Output arguments only 

DONE
The value of DONE is never used (i.e. found on the right hand side of an expression), so no old value from the main program is used, so this is not an input argument. DONE is, however, assigned to, so that value gets passed out of the function, back to the main program, hence it's an output argument. 

c) Both input and output arguments

VALUE
The old value of VALUE is used on the right hand side of VALUE = VALUE + 1
(i.e. the value of VALUE from the main program). The left hand side now has the new value of VALUE, to be passed back to the main program. So VALUE is both an input argument *and* an output argument.
