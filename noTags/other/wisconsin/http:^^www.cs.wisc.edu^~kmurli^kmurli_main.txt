Hi Netsurfer,

 I am a grad student at Wisconsin-Madison. If u dont know , Madison has been rated the second most liveable city in the whole of the US and is the capital of Wisconsin. Univ of Wisconsin-Madison is the third largest campus in the US and the CS dept has been ranked as the second best in the whole country for Databases. 

I come from India, a land of peace , spices and heat ( I really miss the hot weather )

I am currently doing my graduate work in  Computer Sciences  ( No specialisation yet !! But I like Networks and Databases ). My  RESUME  is available here in  ASCII  and in  Postscript   versions. 

My undergrad degree was from  CEG  - College of Engineering , Guindy , a nice big College in   Chennai (Madras)  ,  India  , that has been there for 200 years.

I love to travel and adventure . As they say "Travel is an adventure" and I get lots of it ! U name it and I ve had it !- Like wandering alone in London, getting stranded at an airport ,.. and so on. And I really wanna get some  "real " adventure. As far as I am concerned , Alls well that ends well!

I also love gardening , having pets , listening to weather reports and news ! 

Signing off , 
 Muralidhar K
