Postscript version of 
 resume 




 Objective 
A career in design and development of systems software.
My background being in core system areas like databases, architecture,
operating systems and compilers and non traditional ones like the web.




 Work Experience 


Summer internship in the Integrated Database Server Solutions group at the
 IBM Almaden  research centre 
My primary project involved adding certain optimizations to the DB2 query 
optimizer for queries involving merge joins and studying their impact using
the TPCD benchmark suite.
In the last few days I also did a performance study on web server 
(MIS in particular) scalability on SMP's(running Windows NT) using the SPEC 
web benchmark suite.

Summer internship at a defence research establishment in India ('93)

Worked on a graphics project developing a visualization tool for the 
manufacturing process of a fighter plane (India's LCA).

Teaching Assistant at Wisconsin-Madison
 Have graded and consulted for cs302(C++ programming) and cs536(Compilers)




 Academic Background 

M.S.
Masters degree in Computer Science(expected Dec '96) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a current GPA of 4.0/4.0
BTech.
Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering
from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur with a GPA of 9.9/10.0 (received the first prize for academic excellence at the institute level, after the end of the 2 year common core curriculum)





 Skills 

Programming Languages
Proficient in C, C++ and JAVA
Have also programmed in SML, Prolog, Pascal, Fortran and Basic

OS Platforms
Unix and Windows NT
Other

SQL & Embedded SQL Programming,
Have worked on DB2, Informix and Sybase platforms
Compiler development with Flex & Bison
Network Programming with Unix sockets
Shell programming with Perl
User Interface development with X11/MOTIF
Web related - Java, JVM, HTTP, web caching and information retrieval, SPECweb
