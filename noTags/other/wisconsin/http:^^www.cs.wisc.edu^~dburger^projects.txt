 CS/ChE 838-3
Translated Appbt, one of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks, from FORTRAN
to C and parallelized it for use on a shared-memory multiprocessor.
It was ported to the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel for use as a research
benchmark.
 CS/ECE 757
Studied the effect of limited broadcast cache-coherence protocols
on invalidation traffic in highly parallel shared-memory multiprocessors.
Our measurements were obtained with the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel.
 CS/ECE 755
Designed JIHAD, a ~5500 transistor VLSI DRAM controller, to be used
in a proposed RamLink memory system.  The chip was fabricated and
underwent successful testing (i.e., it worked).
 CS/ECE 752
Designed and simulated (gate-level) CORDIC hardware to approximate
trigonometric functions in IEEE floating point format.
 CS 747
Developed a queueing model to represent a large-scale shared memory
multiprocessor, using homogenous processing nodes and a constant delay
model.
 CS 736
Modified the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel to support simulation of virtual
memory and demand paging, to study paging behavior of parallel
scientific codes on shared-memory multiprocessors. 
 CS 701
Wrote a compiler for ADA/CS, a subset of the ADA programming language.
The target assembler code was a variant of MIPS.
CS/ECE 552
Designed and simulated (gate-level) a simple RISC CPU in the 
Galaxy programming environment.
