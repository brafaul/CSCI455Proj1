The Integrated Microscopy Resource (IMR) is a national resource funded
by the Biological Research Technologies Program of the National Institutes
of Health (NIH). The resource provides innovative instrumentation and skilled
personnel to enable investigators to observe their specimens using powerful,
new light and electron microscopy techniques. Optical sectioning light microscopy
can provide 3-D dynamic (4-D) information on live specimens while rapid
cryo preservation techniques allow ultrastructural characterization at a
defined timepoint. Topographic and ultrastructural information can be obtained
by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) respectively. The integrating of LM, FESEM and
TEM is capable of providing the combination of structural and functional
information. The IMR has an active instrumentation development program that
is aimed at developing improved methods of optical sectioning microscopy
for in vivo imaging. In addition, specimen preparation techniques
are being developed that allow samples to be preserved with a high degree
of structural fidelity for FESEM and TEM.

The Integrated Microscopy Resource Web site has been selected by
The McKinley Group's professional editorial team as a "4-Star" site.
