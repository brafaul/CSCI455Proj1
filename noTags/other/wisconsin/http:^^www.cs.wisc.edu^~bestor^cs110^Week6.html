User-Defined Functions


FORTRAN has pre-defined or built-in mathematical functions.
      
	X = SQRT(Y) * SIN(X*Y) + NINT(3.2)
      
Functions are small independent program modules that compute commonly used values.  Highly reusable.
      
	           +----------+
	 In        |          |      Out
	 Y=9 ----> |  SQRT(Y) | ----> 3
	           |          |
	           +----------+
      
Functions take one or more input values called arguments, to produce a single output value called the result.
      
	Y = COS(X)
	C = MOD(A, B)
			
	Function    Arguments    Result
	--------    ---------    ------
	COS         X            cosine of X
	MOD         A, B         remainder of A/B
      
Functions simplify or break-down a larger problem into a series of smaller problems, called top-down design.
   
User-Defined Functions

Can define your own functions and use them in your program.
      Resemble mini-programs.  Very similar structure.
      
	Function Header
	Argument Declarations
	Local Variable Declarations
	Main Executable Section
	RETURN
	END
      
	Example: compute the area of a circle.
      
	      REAL FUNCTION AREAC (RADIUS)
	C     Computes the area of a circle with
	C     a radius of RADIUS.

	C     Declare RADIUS argument
	      REAL RADIUS

	C     Declare local variables/constants
	      REAL PI
	      PARAMETER (PI = 3.14159)

	C     Compute result
	      AREAC = PI * (RADIUS ** 2)

	      RETURN
	      END
      

Calling User-Defined Functions

User-defined functions are written after the main program.
      
	      PROGRAM TEST
	C     ------------------------------------
	C                 Main program
	C     ------------------------------------
	      REAL TWRAD, TWAREA, AREAC

	      PRINT *, 'Enter radius of tower'
	      READ *, TWRAD
	      PRINT *, 'Area is ', AREAC(TWRAD)

	      STOP
	      END


	C     ------------------------------------
	C              User-defined Functions
	C     ------------------------------------
	      REAL FUNCTION AREAC (RADIUS)
	      ...
	      RETURN
	      END
      
User-defined functions are called from the main program just like any other function; i.e. part of an arithmetic expression.
      User-defined functions can be called from inside other functions.
   Exception: functions cannot call themselves (called recursion).
      Important: Function type must be declared like a variable in the main program (or wherever it is called from).
      
	      REAL ..., AREAC
      

Function Header

The function header specifies the name of the function, the type of value it returns, and the name and number of input arguments.
      
	functype FUNCTION funcname (arguments)

	REAL FUNCTION AREAC (RADIUS)
	INTEGER FUNCTION MOD (DIVID, DIVIS)
      
Can also have zero arguments, but unusual.
      
	INTEGER FUNCTION FOO ( )
      
Only the argument names are listed in the function header.
   
Argument Declarations

The type of the arguments is specified immediately after the function header but before any local variables.
      Declare arguments just like declaring variables.
      
	REAL RADIUS
	INTEGER DIVID, DIVIS
      
Also called dummy arguments.
   
Actual Arguments

The value of the dummy arguments are initialized to the corresponding values in the function call, called the actual arguments.
      
	...
	Y = 10
	X = AREAC(Y)
	PRINT *, AREAC(10 * Y + 3)
	STOP
	END

	REAL FUNCTION AREAC (RADIUS)
	...
	RETURN
	END


	Actual Argument      Dummy Argument
	---------------      --------------
	Y                    RADIUS = 10
	10 * Y + 3           RADIUS = 33
      
Number and type of actual arguments must correspond to number and type of dummy arguments.  Specified in same order.
      Actual arguments may be variables, literals or expressions.
   
Local Variables

As with the main program, user-defined functions may need to store intermediate results in variables.
      Variables declared within a function are called local variables because they can only be used locally within the function.
      Important: Variables declared in another function or in the main program cannot be used within a function!
      Do not re-assign argument variables within a function (called side-effects).
      
	INTEGER FUNCTION FACT (N)
	INTEGER N
	INTEGER COUNT, TEMP
      

   Right:
      
	TEMP = 1
	DO COUNT = 1, N
	   TEMP = TEMP * COUNT
	END DO
	FACT = TEMP
      
   Wrong:
      
	DO COUNT = 1, N-1
	   N = N * COUNT
	END DO
	FACT = N
      

Function Result

The purpose of a function is to compute and return a result.
      The result of a function is the last value assigned to the function name using a normal assignment statement.
      
	funcname = value


	INTEGER FUNCTION FACT (N)
	...
	FACT = TEMP
	RETURN
	END
      

RETURN Statement

The RETURN statement exits the function and resumes execution in the main program (or wherever it was called from).
      Normally the last statement in a function before the END.
   
END Statement

Always the last statement in a function.
      Specifies the end of the function definition.
   
Order of Execution

Program executes all the statements from program header to END.
      
	PROGRAM FOO                                          |
	...                                                  |
	END                                                  V
      
IF statement branches to execute different sections of code.
      
	IF (BAR .NE. 0) THEN                                 |
	   ...                                           ____o____ 
	ELSE                                             |       |
	   ...                                           |__> <__|
	END IF                                               |
	                                                     V
      
DO loop goes back and re-executes code.
      
	DO BAR = 1, 10                                       |
	   ...                                               + <__
	END DO                                               |   |
	                                                     +___|
	                                                     |
 	                                                     V
     
When call a function, jumps down and execute all the function statements.  Return back to the main program on RETURN.
      
	PRINT *, FACT(Y)                    Main        Function
	STOP                                 |       ____> |
	END                                  |      /      |
	                                     * ____/       |
	REAL FUNCTION FACT (N)               | <____       |
	...                                  |      \      |
	RETURN                               V       \____ V
      



Subroutines


Functions return a single value, usually a number, and implement some mathematical function.
      
	      INTEGER FUNCTION FACT (N)
	C     Computes the factorial of N
      
Subroutines can return any number of values and can perform any sort of operation.
      
	      SUBROUTINE GRAPH (MIN, MAX, POWER)
	C     Print a graph of Y = X^POWER from X=MIN to X=MAX
      
Subroutines also take one or more input values (i.e. arguments) but may or may not return any results.
      
	                +----------+
	MIN=0     In    |          | 
	MAX=10   ---->  |  GRAPH   | 
	POWER=2         |          |
	                +----------+
      

User-Defined Subroutines

Subroutines resemble functions.
      
	Subroutine Header
	Argument Declarations
	Local Variable Declarations
	Main Executable Section
	RETURN
	END
      
Note: Subroutine header does not return a value.
      Example: split a REAL number into to its whole and fractional parts.
      
	      SUBROUTINE BREAK (X, WHOLE, FRAC)
	C     Break a real number into its
	C     whole and fractional parts
	
	C     Declare arguments
	      REAL X, FRAC
	      INTEGER WHOLE

	      WHOLE = INT(X)
	      FRAC = X - REAL(INT(X))

	      RETURN
	      END
      

Calling Subroutines

Subroutines are written with functions after the main program.
      Subroutines are explicitly called from the main program using the CALL statement.
      
	CALL GRAPH(1, 10, 2)
	CALL BREAK(10.3, IPART, FPART)
      
Subroutines can be called from inside other subroutines or functions (but no recursion).
   
Subroutine Header

The subroutine header specifies the name of the subroutine and the name and number of arguments.
      
	SUBROUTINE subname (arguments)


	SUBROUTINE GRAPH (MIN, MAX, POWER)
	SUBROUTINE BREAK (X, WHOLE, FRAC)
      
Can also have zero arguments, not unusual.
      
	SUBROUTINE MENU ( )
      

Argument Declarations

As with functions, the type of the arguments is specified immediately after the subroutine header.
   
Local Variables

As with functions, subroutines may need to store intermediate results in variables.
      Local variables can only be used locally within the subroutine.
   
Subroutine Results

Some subroutines do not return any values; e.g. GRAPH just draws a graph on the screen.
      Other subroutines return one or more values; e.g. BREAK takes one input value and returns two output values.
      A result is returned to the main program when the arguments are re-assigned inside the subroutine.  Arguments pass values both into the subroutine as well as out of it.
      
	                +----------+
	MIN=0     In    |          | 
	MAX=10   ---->  |  GRAPH   | 
	POWER=2         |          |
	                +----------+

	                +----------+
	          In    |          |   Out   WHOLE=10
	X=10.3   ---->  |   BREAK  |  ---->  FRAC=0.3
	                |          |
	                +----------+
      
Note: Unlike functions, the subroutine name is not assigned a value.
   
Input Arguments

Input arguments pass values into the subroutine, just like functions.
      Input arguments should not be re-assigned.
      As with functions, the actual arguments in the subroutine call may be literals, variables or expressions.
      
	CALL GRAPH(X-10, X+10, 2)
	CALL BREAK(10.3, ...)
      

Output Arguments

Output arguments pass values back out to the main program. Similar to function results except multiple values can be passed.
      Unlike input arguments, output arguments must be re-assigned to a new value to pass it back out.
      VERY IMPORTANT: The actual arguments in the subroutine call must always be variables.
      These variables are re-assigned inside the subroutine, hence the new values get passed back out to the main program.
      
	CALL BREAK(10.3, IPART, FPART)
	PRINT *, IPART, FPART	(10   0.3)
	STOP
	END


	SUBROUTINE BREAK (X, WHOLE, FRAC)
	...
	WHOLE = INT(X)
	FRAC = X - REAL(WHOLE)
	RETURN
	END
      
When the dummy arguments WHOLE and FRAC are re-assigned, the actual arguments IPART and FPART are re-assigned too.
      Actual and dummy argument names do not need to have the same name.
      Output arguments only pass values out.  The original values of IPART and FPART, if any, are ignored.
   
Input/Output Arguments

Some arguments can pass values both into and out of the subroutine.  Called input/output arguments.
      
	      SUBROUTINE SORT (NUM1, NUM2)
	C     Sorts two numbers so that NUM1<=NUM2

	C     Input/Output Arguments
	      INTEGER NUM1, NUM2

	C     Local Variables
	      INTEGER TEMP

	C     Sort the numbers
	      IF (NUM1 .GT. NUM2) THEN
	         TEMP = NUM1
	         NUM1 = NUM2
	         NUM2 = TEMP
	      END IF

	      RETURN
	      END


	Input arguments:   NUM1, NUM2
	Output arguments:  NUM1, NUM2
