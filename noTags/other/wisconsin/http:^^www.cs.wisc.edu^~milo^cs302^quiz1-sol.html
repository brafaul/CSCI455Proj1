Quiz 1 Solutions


 (2 points) Briefly define the term "algorithm".

 
  I accepted many answers for this question.  The book's definition
is ``An algorithm is a sequence of precise instructions that leads to a solution.''

 
 (2 points) State one reason that you might want to use
       functions in a C++ program.

  

There are many possible answers, some examples are: procedural
abstraction, breaking a program into simpler parts, code readablity,
reuseable code, using code that someone else wrote for you, etc.

 
 (2 points) State one of the three types of programming errors we
talked about and describe an example of that type.

 

The three types are errors are: compile time error, run time error
and logical error, I also accepted syntax error.  A compile time
errors is when the compiler can't understand your code, so fails why
attempting to compile your program.  A run time error is when your
program fails and crashes when it is executed.  A logical error
occurs when the program does not report any errors and compile or run
time, but does not produce the correct results.

 
 (2 points) Declare a variable named "number" of type integer
and initialize it to be 17.

 
int number = 17;
 
 (2 points) Declare a constant named "CM_PER_INCH" to be 2.54.
         
const double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
 
 (5 points) What is the output of the following program?


#include&ltiostream.h>

int main() 
{
  int counter = 3, value = 2;
  while (counter < 7) {
    value = value * 2;
    cout << "Value is " << value << endl;
    if ((counter % 2) == 0) { 
      cout << "Counter is " << counter << endl;
    }
    counter++;
  }
}


Answer:

Value is 4
Value is 8
Counter is 4
Value is 16
Value is 32
Counter is 6

 (5 points) Write a function "calculate_score" which calculates
and returns one team's score of a football game given the number of
touchdowns, field goals, and extra points that team scored (in that
order).  In football touchdowns are worth 6 points, field goals are 3
points, and each extra points is 1 point.  The score can be calculated
by summing the number of each type of score multiplied by the value of
that score.

So for example, using your function, I could write the following code
segment:


int viking_score, packer_score;

// 3 Touchdowns, 3 field goals, 3 extra points
viking_score = calculate_score(3, 3, 3); 

// 3 Touchdowns, 0 field goals, 3 extra points
packer_score = calculate_score(3, 0, 3);

if (viking_score > packer_score) {
  cout << "Vikings win." << endl;
} else if (packer_score < viking_score) {
  cout << "Packers win." << endl;
} else {
  cout << "Tie game." << endl;
}


Write your code for the function below:


int calculate_score(int td, int fg, int ep) 
{
  return ((td * 6) + (fg * 3) + ep);
}
