Career Goals

Challenging hardware/software development.
		To design the next generation of 
		    high-performance microprocessor,
		    going beyond out-of-order dynamic execution
		    and instruction level parallelism
		    towards meso-scale parallelism.
		To apply the technical management concepts
		    that can create a "Breakthrough System" 
		    for creative work like Computer Architecture;
		    to recreate Thomas Edison's "Invention Factory"
		    in the modern world.
