Formatting Dollar Amounts in Program 2


Formatting Dollar Amounts in Program 2

You might be wondering how to line up the dollar amounts for Program 2 so
that everything looks nice like the example output.  This involves two
steps:



 Telling the computer to print floating-point nuumbers
       using exactly two decimal places
   Making the dollar amounts line up at their decimal point



The necessary material is described on pages 51 and 232 of the
Savitch text (pages 65-66 of Perry & Levin).  However, I'll explain
here just what you need to know for the assignment.



Consider this silly little program:



#include <iostream.h>

int main ()
{
    double amount_deposited = 100.0;
    double cash_received    = 9.71;
    cout << "Amount deposited: $" << amount_deposited << endl;
    cout << "Cash received:    $" << cash_received << endl;
    cout << "Net deposit:      $" << (amount_deposited - cash_received) << endl;
    return 0;
}



When run, it produces the following output:



Amount deposited: $100
Cash recieved:    $9.71
Net deposit:      $90.29



But what we want is something more like this:



Amount deposited: $ 100.00
Cash recieved:    $   9.71
Net deposit:      $  90.29



We can modify the above program to achieve this:



#include <iostream.h>
#include <iomanip.h>

int main ()
{
    // Force two decimal places (see p. 51 of Savitch text)
    cout.setf(ios::fixed);
    cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
    cout.precision(2);

    double amount_deposited = 100.0;
    double cash_received    = 9.71;

    // The "setw(7)" below causes the next thing printed to
    // have a width of seven
    cout << "Amount deposited: $"
         << setw(7) << amount_deposited << endl;
    cout << "Cash received:    $"
         << setw(7) << cash_received << endl;
    cout << "Net deposit:      $"
         << setw(7) << (amount_deposited - cash_received) << endl;
    return 0;
}



Note the extra #include<iomanip.h> directive at the top of the
program.  This is necessary to use setw.
