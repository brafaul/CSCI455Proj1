CS 110 Section 2 - Late Policy


 Late Policy


Programming assignments are due at the end of class on the date specified.  Any assignments handed in after class but before midnight the following day receive an automatic penalty of 20%.  For each subsequent day late another 20% is deducted (weekends count as two days).  Finally, no assignment will be accepted five or more days late.

Many of your programming assignments will be handed in online.  When you hand in an assignment online the files are timestamped with the current time and date when you copy them to your handin directory.  This timestamp will be used to check they were handed in on time or whether late day penalties apply.

If you are asked to hand in a printed copy of your program and output then hand it in in class on the date specified.  If you must hand in printouts late then please give them to me in person.  If this is not possible then you must get another TA or consultant to sign and date your work and slip it under my office door or put it in my mailbox on the 5th floor.  In the absence of a signature and date the hand-in time is determined by when I receive it, which could be several days later. Make sure you have your name and section number clearly written on any printouts that you hand in.

To avoid handing in your assignments late I strongly recommend starting them as soon as possible.  Debugging a program and getting it to work correctly can take significantly longer than you expect!
