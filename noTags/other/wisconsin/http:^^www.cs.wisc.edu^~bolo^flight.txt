Slipping the Surly Bonds of Earth



Slipping the Surly Bonds of Earth

Bolo's a certified (or is that certifiable) airplane pilot!

I currently hold a Commercial Pilot's License with
Instrument and Single Engine Land ratings.
I was planning on working on a Flight Instructors certificate
this year, but moving into and taking care of
my new house
has started consuming free time.

Normally I fly a Piper Cherokee, either an
Arrow or an Archer.
I have been known to pilot a Cessna on occasion.

The Grumman Tiger has always fascinated me.
I'd like to either spend some time flying one, and perhaps
get a "checkout" in it.
If you know of any for rent in the vicinity of Madison, WI, USA,
please tell me!

Several years ago, I used to own part of an airplane,
a Piper Cherokee 140.
We spent a lot of time, and 2.5 ratings, together before I
had to sell that wonderful plane.
If you see N5755U, say "hi" for me!

If you were wondering about the title of this page, it's
a reference to a memorable poem, 
High Flight,
by John C. Magee.

Other Pilots
