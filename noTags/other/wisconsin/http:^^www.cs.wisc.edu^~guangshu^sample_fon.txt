Family Medicine Data Viewer



Family Medicine Data Viewer 

 This page is used for graphically browsing data in Dept. of Family Medicine. The graphs were generated using DEVise. You can view the number of visits, procedures (associated with dollars), diagnosis etc for every day, week, month, year and for each doctor by clicking on teh buttons. You can also see some comparative charts between clinics. The future work on this project includes daily on-line access to the above data, immunization rates by clinic and by doctor, and child bearing studies.
