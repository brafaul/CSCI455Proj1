 Experience 

1996 Summer: Xerox, DITC, Webster, NY  
Technical Intern. Worked on a color-image processing project.
1995 Summer: UW-Madison, WI 
Research Assistant. Conducted some research on off-line hand writing recognition, under the direction of professor Dyer.
1992-1994: Graduate School of Peking University, Beijing, China.
Research Assistant. Developped an Multimedia CAI(Computer-Aided Instruction) System, based on MDK(Multimedia Development Kit) of M.S. Windows 3.1, combining voice, graphic, text and animation together.
1992: Great Wall Computer Company, Beijing, China.
Technical Intern. Worked on an Image Processing Project. My works in this project including noise removal, sharping, motion blur and edge detection.
1990-1991: Peking University, Beijing, China.
Work in a Scientific Visualization Project. My job in this project is to draw 3-D mathematical equations and show the intersection, union and difference of any number of equations.



Courses I enjoy in Madison


CS458-Computer Graphics.
My final project was a 3-D walking robotic, using Phigs and Motif. 
Here is the Code.


CS533-Image Processing.
There are several projects in the course, such
as motion blur an image, noise removal, etc., using software MatLab 


CS540-Artificial Intelligence.

    There was a programming competition in the class: a robotic want to clean the dirts
in a room, and we are asked to write a heuristic function which minimizes both the length of walking route and 
the running time to find that route. I won the
    first place. Here is my Code.


CS736-Advanced Operating System.
Paper reading course. My final project was a Thread Management Package which includes all the nessesary feature of an
ordinary Thread Package. I also built 3 applications based on my package: Producer/Consumer problem,
Client/Server model and Quick Sort . Here is the Code.


CS764-Database.
Paper reading course which covered almost all the advanced topics of database. My final project is Moving the moose DBMS from Informix to Shore. Here is the code and final report.


CS766-Computer Vision.
Paper Reading course. HW including Skeleton, Image spline and Snake. My final project is the Image Mosaicing.Here is the code and final report. 


CS990-Independent Study.
My advisor was professor Dyer. My research topic is the 
    off-line    
    handwriting recognition. Here is the final report in PostScript format.


CS532: Pattern Recognition
 


CS558: Computional Geometry
 


ECE602: Neural Network
 


CS838: Information Retrieval
