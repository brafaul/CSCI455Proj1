 General Comments 

The projects are intended to give you an opportunity to study a
particular area related to operating systems.
Some of the projects will require test implementations, measurement studies,
simulations, or some combination.
Most will require a literature search before you begin.

The project suggestions below are briefly stated.
They are intended to guide you into particular areas, and you
are expected to expand these suggestions into a full project
descriptions.
This gives you more freedom in selecting an area and more burden in
defining your own project.
There may be more issues listed for a project than you can cover.

I would prefer you to think up a topic that is not
listed below.

If you do, you might want to come
and talk with me so we can work out a reasonable project description. 

Some projects are appropriate for groups of two or more.
There is no upper bound on the size of the group, but beware that groups
of more than 3 persons are very hard to manage.
I will not get involved in labor disputes;
you will all hang together or you will be all hanged separately.
Feel free to ask me for my opinions whether the size of a proposed team
is appropriate for a given project.

In some cases, a project area straddles the boundary between operating systems
and some other area (such as database, architecture, artificial intelligence,
or programming languages).
Such projects are intended for students with background and interests in
the second area to explore the interface.
They are not intended as substitutes for the regular courses in the second
area.
For example, if you have little or no background in database,
you should take CS 764 before choosing a topic that requires database
sophistication.
Most topics call for a careful literature search
before
the proposal due date.


 Due Dates 


Project Proposal Due  Tuesday, October 17

Final Report Due  Thursday, December 14



 Project Proposal 


You are to hand in an expanded description of your project (see the
due date above; you are free to turn it in sooner).
The project proposal should be brief (two pages or less), but very specific
about what you intend to do.
It must be long enough to convince me that you have a reasonable and
achievable project (i.e, not trivial and not too large).
You may have to revise your description before it will be acceptable.

The project description should describe the problem that you are addressing,
how you will go about working on this project (the steps you will take),
what results you expect and what you expect to produce,
what resources you will need,
and a brief schedule for your project.
It must be reasonably well written.
Projects that involve implementation or simulation should indicate what
resources are required.

You should make an ordered list of features together with your current
best guess on what you intend to accomplish together with contingency plans
in case of unforeseen problems (``I will definitely do
(a) and then (b).  If a.3 turns out to be impractical, however, I will do
(b') instead.
If time allows, I will also do (c).
If things go especially well, I would also like to try (d), (e), and (f),
in that order'').


You should have already done a substantial amount of background work
on the project before writing the proposal.

For example,
if you intend to do a simulation, you should have familiarized yourself
with all available software tools, and decided which are most appropriate.
If you intend to build a useful tool such as a threads package or a distributed 
make
tool, you should know about all such tools that have been built before and
described in the open literature.
There is no reason why you shouldn't do something that has been done before.
After all, the main purpose of this project is learning.
But if it has been done before, you should learn about previous attempts
so that you can learn from their mistakes rather than simply repeating them
yourselves.

I will review all proposals and offer comments.
Sketchy proposals will get sketchy comments.
I will also indicate my opinion of the quality of each proposal.
The Project Report

At the end of the semester, you will hand in a project report.
The length will vary depending on the type of project, but
no paper should be over 15 pages unless you get specific prior approval for a
longer report.  (A famous person once wrote in a letter,
``Please excuse the length of this letter.
I did not have the time to make it shorter.'')
In all cases, the quality of the writing will be a factor in the grade.
You will also make a short oral presentation to the class and, if appropriate,
demonstrate your software.
Peer Reviewing

Your project report should be read and reviewed by at least one
other person in the class.
It is up to you to select the person.
This person will critique your paper and you will use the critique to
revise your paper.


 Project Suggestions 


Naming in Large Computer Networks:

Consider the naming of resources (e.g., mail address, servers, etc.) in
a distributed environment with many (1000 or more) computers.
This environment might include universities, companies, and government
agencies.
Each of these areas might include other environments (e.g., the university
might include a CS department, computer center, ECE department, etc.).
A name service
for such an environment is a special-purpose distributed database.
A server can register services.
Each registration includes a description of the service provided (e.g.,
``mail delivery'')
and information necessary to use the service (e.g.,
``connect to address [128.105.2.33], port 25'').
A
client
can look for a specific service (e.g.,
``How do I deliver mail to host gjetost.cs.wisc.edu?'')
or make a more generic request (e.g.,
``Find me a nearby printer that allows student access and supports
PostScript''.

Design a name service for such an environment.
Issues such as performance, local autonomy, scope of authority, reliability,
protection, and expandability may be discussed.
How are names used?  (What studies might you do to find out?)
What are the limits on the size of the environment that your design
will be able to support?
Evaluate your design through a pilot implementation or a simulation.

For background, read about Grapevine, Clearinghouse, the Arpanet Domain
Name Service (see me for more specific references).


Group Communication:

Several researchers have developed protocols and software packages to
facilitate communication among processes in a distributed program.
A process supplies information by delivering messages to the system
and consumes it by registering requests.
The system forwards each message to processes that expressed interest
in it.
Details differ considerably among the various proposals.
Examples include the FIELD system from Brown university, the ISIS system
from Cornell, and the Linda language from the University of Maryland.
Numerous other proposals may be seen as variations on this theme, including
other past and proposed 736 projects such as DREGS, Condor, and the
switchboard.
Among the dimensions of variability  are

Implementation.
Some systems are implemented by a central server.
Others are fully distributed, using broadcasts of messages and/or requests.
Other possibilities include establishment of explicit routing trees, or
using a central server only to introduce processes to one another and
allowing them to engage in bilateral or multilateral communication thereafter.
Reliability and Security.
Some systems go to great lengths to cope with process and network failures,
authentication and security, or out-of-order delivery, while others
largely ignore these problems.
Matching and Synchronization.
Systems differ in criteria for matching messages with requests.
The simplest approach is to require an exact match:
Each message has a
``message type''
and each request specifies an interest in all messages of that type.
Other schemes involve regular-expression string matching, general Boolean
expressions, or Prolog-like unification.
A related issue is whether a message is delivered to a single process
(perhaps with some priority ordering), multicast to all who are interested,
or saved for those who may request it in the future.
Requests can be blocking or non-blocking.
Data Types.
Messages may be simple untyped byte strings or they may be typed structures.
The system may provide type checking facilities, to make sure the receiver
interprets the data as the sender intended, and it may even provide
automatic data conversion among integer or floating-point representations,
character sets, etc.
A concrete example is Linda, which maintains a single, conceptually global
tuple space .
Linda provides the primitives
 put 
which adds a tuple to tuple space,
 get 
which waits for a tuple with a give first component to appear and then
removes it from the space, and
 read 
which waits for a matching tuple, but does not remove it from the space.



Security Audit:

A properly managed computer system should
be secure from illegal entry.
Normal users should not be able to obtain privileges beyond what they are
given.
Most systems in everyday have security holes.
Normally, it is considered a violation of standards of ethical behavior
to take advantage of such holes.
However, a
``tiger team''
is a team specifically authorized to find as many security holes as possible
and report them to responsible management.

Select a facility in the Computer Sciences
Department or elsewhere and find, demonstrate, and document as many security
problems as possible.
You may attack the system either from the position of an
``ordinary''
user, with an account but no special privileges, or from the point of view
of an outsider--someone who is not supposed to be able to access the
facility at all.
You should find as many security problems as possible.
These problems include system flaws, improper management, and careless
users.
The results of this study should be a report of the problems, with
suggestions for fixes in the system, system design,
and changes in management procedures.
You should
not
explore
``denial of service''
attacks such as jamming networks or crashing systems.
Warning:
A project of this kind must be approved in advance by the
person responsible for the facility you are proposing to attack!

File Servers for Workstations:

Workstations are available with and without local disks.
Bulk storage is provided by a combination of remote file servers, local
disk, and local RAM memory.
Servers provide remote devices, remote files,
or other abstractions.
A variety of schemes for providing a
``seamless''
global file service have been suggested, including remote disk simulation,
remote file access (e.g. NFS from Sun Microsystems)
whole-file caching
on local disk as in the Carnegie-Mellon ITC system (Andrew file system)
and use of large local
RAM for file caching, as in the Sprite system from Berkeley.
The Locus system should also be studied for ideas about transparent global
file naming.

Design a scheme for file access for a network of workstations.
You should specify the functionality that is provided by the server and the
responsibility of the client workstation.
You will want to discuss reliability, fault tolerance, protection, and
performance.
Compare your design to the designs published in the literature.
Evaluate the design by performing a simulation.
See the
``Spritely NFS''
paper by Srinivasan and Mogul and the award-winning paper by Shirriff and
Ousterhout from the Winter 1992 USENIX (see me for a copy)
for examples of similar studies.
See also related papers in SOSP proceedings over the last several years.


Load Balancing:

Many systems such as LOCUS, Sprite, or Condor allows you to start
processes on any machine, move processes during execution,
and access files (transparently) across machine boundaries.
Automatic placement of processes and other system resources could
substantially improve overall system performance.
There are several interesting issues in load balancing, including


Collection of Data for Load Balancing:
To make a load balancing decision, you might need data from each
machine in the network.
There are many forms that this data can take, and many designs for
communicating this among machines.
You must decide what data is needed, from where the data must come,
and how it must be communicated.

This problem becomes interesting in the scope of a very large network
of computers (1000's of machines).
You do not want to consume huge amounts of system resources making
these decisions, and you do not want to make decisions based on
extremely old data.

Policies for Load Balancing Decisions:
How do you decided when to move a process?
On what do you base your decision?
How frequently can we move processes (what is thrashing like in this
environment)?
What about groups of processes that are cooperating?

Metrics for Load Evaluation:
What load metrics do you use in evaluating an individual machine's
capacity?
Are these related to processing?  storage?  communication?
How do we (can we) measure these?
Are they accurate reflections of a machine's performance?
How can you demonstrate this?

File migration:
We can move files, as well as processes.
When do you move files vs. processes?
Is only one needed?
Which is better?
How can you tell?


You are warned that is quite easy to suggest many
plausible
schemes for load balancing but not so easy to evaluate them.
Therefore, a major component of any project in this area will be
evaluation through simulation.


Security and Authentication:

The Popek and Kline paper on the reading list discusses use of encryption
for authentication in distributed systems.
It considers both conventional and public-key schemes.
One popular implementation based on these ideas is the Kerberos system
from MIT.
Kerberos has been used to provide secure remote login, file transfer,
and remote file access.

Use Kerberos or an
ad hoc
package to enhance the security of some existing system.


Random Software testing:

This suggestion is from Prof. Bart Miller.

This past Fall, in CS736, I had some students work on more of that random
software testing.
The result is

a pretty nice paper

that we just submitted to CACM.
One interesting result was that the utilities from GNU and Linux were
substantially
more crash-resistant than ones from the seven commercial systems that we tested
(SunOS, Solaris, AIX, Ultrix, HP-UX, Irix, NEXTSTEP).

There are a bunch more things that can be done in this work:

test more of the
new BSD UNIX systems, such as netBSD, freeBSD, BSDi;
test applications on
Windows and Macs;
test more of the system library interfaces.

I'd be happy to help supervise any projects in this area.


Navigating the World-Wide Web

The World-Wide Web is growing at an unbelievable pace.
There's a tremendous amount of information available, but
finding what you want can be next to impossible.
Quite a few
on-line search engines
have been created to aid in resource location on
the web.
Check the

Directory pull-down menu of

NetScape for some examples.
(Of particular note is WebCrawler, written by Wisconsin alumnus Brian Pinkerton,
who recently sold it to America Online, reputedly for over $1 million!)

There are lots of ways of tackling this problem, but none discovered thus
far is entirely satisfactory.
Among the variables in design space are

Server Support
Does the provider of information cooperate in advertising it, or
is the search entirely client-driven?
Caching
Does each search start from scratch, or is some sort of ``database'' used
to guide the search?
In the latter case, where is the database kept (at the client, the server,
or somewhere in between)?
How is it created?
How is stale information detected and updated?
How is the cache purged of valid, but seldom-referenced information?
Search Strategy
How does the search determine which information will be of interest
to the user?
How does determine which links to traverse, and in what order?
When does it know when it has gone far enough?


Topology of the Web

A project closely related to  the previous suggestion
 is to collect and analyze information about the current structure of
the web.
The web can be viewed as a vast directed graph.
Gather as much information you can about this graph an analyze it.
What is the average number of links out of a page?
What is the average size of a page.
What is the average distance between the pages at the two ends of a link
(where ``distance'' is the number of links along a shortest path)?
More generally, what are the distributions of these statistics?
How do these things vary over time?

Information from this project would be of great interest to people proposing
algorithms for traversing the web.
This project has two distinct parts, both potentially quite challenging:
gathering the data and analyzing it.


Self-perpetuating programs:

The
``Worm''
program propagated itself across many machines,
automatically repairing parts that were damaged or destroyed.
A worm is extremely difficult to kill.
You should design a strategy to building worms on one of our systems.
You will also need to determine how you might (constructively) use a
worm program--i.e., what applications are there for this type of
program?

This project could involve a design, test implementation(s), and study
and evaluation of the implementation.
Is there a generic structure such that you can take a
large class of algorithms and automatically make them into worm-type
programs?


A General-Purpose Transaction Package:

The concept of a
transaction--a sequence of actions that are executed atomicly and
either commit (are reliably preserved forever) or abort (are completely
undone)--was
developed in the context of database systems, but transactions are useful in
many areas outside of traditional database applications.
Design and implement a portable transaction package.
Look at
Camelot ,
developed in the context of Mach, and
libtb ,
built by Margo Seltzer and described in a recent Usenix proceedings.


Distributed Shared Memory:

There been a great deal of interest recently in an architecture called
``distributed shared memory''.
The basic idea is to simulate a shared-memory multiprocessor programming
model on top of a distributed system (a local-area network) by altering
the page-fault handler of a traditional operating system to fetch
pages over the network rather than the local disk.
The 1991 SOSP contains a paper on an operating system called
Munin ,
which
explores some of the tradeoffs in page placement and replacement policies
to support a variety of applications efficiently.
Explore these issues by constructing a simulation.
See also the  Wisconsin Wind Tunnel (WWT) 
project for related research.


Performance Study:

Monitor one or more of the Computer Science Department's machines or
networks to determine its characteristics.
Where are the bottlenecks?
What sorts of programs are producing most of the load.
What causes spikes in usage (and corresponding drops in response)?

For example, in a recent
USENIX conference Matt Blaze describes a publicly
available program for eavesdropping on NFS traffic on a local area Ethernet
and gathering statistics.
Install this program, use it to gather some statistics, and compare them
with similar data from the literature.
See also the suggestions regarding distributed file systems above.


Distributed or Persistent Garbage:

The problem of garbage collection (finding and reclaiming space allocated
to inaccessible objects) has been well studied for almost 30 years.
Algorithms can be roughly classified as explicit deletion
(``It's my data and I'll throw it away when I want to!''),
reference counting
(``Will the last one out please turn off the lights?''),
mark-and-sweep
(``Unclaimed goods will be recycled''),
and generational
(``When the ashtray is full it's time to buy a new car'').
Recently, there's been a resurgence of research in garbage collection spurred
by two developments:
distributed systems
(``I can't throw this away because somebody in France may still want it'')
and persistent programming languages (the Pampers problem:
The only thing worse than garbage is persistent garbage).
Well known garbage collection algorithms that work fine for physical or
virtual memory are terrible when pointers can cross continents or disk
cylinders.
Interesting algorithms for a disk-based or distributed environment have
been proposed (see me for references).
Study some of these algorithms, and either suggest improvements or implement
them and study their performance.


Consumer Reports:

Many people are generating software and making it freely available on
the network for
``anonymous ftp.''
Often, there are several packages available for the same or similar purposes.
Much of this software is worth exactly what it costs, but some of it is
as good as, if not better than, expensive
``commercial''
products.
Select two or more related programs and do a careful comparative critical
review.
Depending on the nature of programs, the review might be a benchmarking
study of relative performance, an analysis of functionality or ease-of-use,
or some combination of these factors.

One area of particular interest is file accessing and indexing packages
(if this were cs764, I would call them low-level database facilities).
Examples are the WISS and Exodus storage managers, both written here,
and the dbm and libdb packages from Berkeley (the latter is in the
yet-to-be-released 4.4BSD version of Unix, but we have a early version of
this code).

A related suggestion is to compare implementations of Unix and alternative
ways of achieving the same function in different ways.
For example, consider the question,
``What's the best way to get data from one process to another?''
Under various flavors of Unix you can use TCP or UDP, Unix-domain sockets,
pipes, fifo's, shared memory, files, or at least three different flavors
of remote procedure call.
The answer depends on the versions of Unix involved, and various
characteristics of the communication desired (such as the amount of data
to be transferred, the sizes of messages, whether replies are required,
the degree of reliability needed, etc.)
I've written a rough program that tests many of these techniques.
I would like someone to polish the program a bit and use it to do an evaluation
of many of the IPC mechanisms available.


Condor:

Condor is a locally-written utility that makes unused cpu power on
idle workstations available for productive use.
A daemon process on each workstation monitors activity and reports to
a central resource manager.
A client who wishes to run a long cpu-bound program contacts the resource
manager to obtain the name of an idle workstation.
It then contacts the selected server workstation and sends the job to be
executed.
Jobs to be run under Condor are linked with a version of the
C library that handles system calls specially:
File I/O calls are turned into requests sent back to a
shadow
process running on the submitting host.
If the server workstation should become non-idle before the job finishes,
the job is checkpointed and restarted on another workstation in the pool.
One user of Condor had a program successfully complete after consuming
over 300 cpu
days
during a period that spanned the department's move to a new building!

Several enhancements to Condor have been considered.


Security:
Server security seems adequate.
Application processes runs with a non-privileged guest user id under control
of a trusted
``starter''
that can kill them at any time.
Providing security for condor users seems much more tricky.
Here the problem is that the shadow, which by design runs under the UID of
the job's owner and has all of that person's privileges, is vulnerable to
``spoofing''
by software on the server machine.
If we assume that the server workstation is owned by a hostile
user who has super-user capabilities, the problem becomes
quite difficult.
Design and implement a mutual-authentication protocol, perhaps using
the Kerberos package.

Multiprocess Jobs:
Currently, Condor only supports jobs consisting of a single UNIX process;
Condor does not support the UNIX
fork
call.
Design extensions to Condor that support a collection of processes connected
by pipes.
Your design must deal with problems such as co-scheduling (making sure
all processes are running at the same time) and maintaining connections
as processes are checkpointed and moved.

Condor Lite:
Condor is designed for single processes that consume many hours of cpu time.
Fixed overhead makes Condor impractical
for short jobs (such as a C compilation).
Consider how to use some of the Condor machinery to produce a
network make
facility.


Other enhancements suggested by Mike Litzkow, principal implementor and
maintainer of Condor, include:


Execution of condor jobs across wide area networks.

Support for a parallel programming model other than pipe/fork/exec
(e.g., Linda).

More sophisticated matching of jobs to available resources.

Checkpointing mechanisms which require less data movement.

Implementation of applications which are well suited to Condor's
capabilities and can really show off its power.
Applications in such
``trendy''
areas as code decryption or genetic engineering are obvious choices.


The current implementation of Condor is available by anonymous ftp.


Specialized NFS Servers:


The Unix File System interface provides a convenient abstraction for
a variety of data beyond ordinary files.
For example,
``classic''
Unix makes I/O devices and communication channels (pipes) look like files.
Some flavors of Unix support other kinds of objects that look like files,
including network connections, 
``named pipes''
and shared-memory regions.
The Network File System
(NFS) provides a convenient path for adding new kinds of
``file-like''
objects without modifying the operating system kernel.
An NFS server running as user-level process can be
``mounted''
in the Unix name space.
Any requests to open, read, or write files in this space are forwarded
to the server.
This trick is used in the CAPITL program-development environment and
the SHORE object-oriented database system to allow access to database
objects from
``legacy''
applications such as compilers, editors,
grep ,
etc. without the need to modify, or even re-link them.
I have written a package of C++ classes that encapsulate all the messy
details of the NFS protocol to create a
``do it yourself''
NFS server kit.
All you have to do is implement the necessary data structures to
simulate Unix file behavior.

Use this kit to provide a Unix-compatible veneer over some other service.
A representative example is FTP.
Write a server that allows you to navigate the space of files accessible
via anonymous FTP as if they were part of the local file system.


Shore:


Shore is an experimental object-oriented database being developed in our
department.
It combines many of the features of traditional databases (concurrency
control and recovery and high-speed bulk operations), object-oriented databases
(fine-grained strongly typed objects with identity), and file systems
(a hierarchical name space with secure protection of objects and Unix
compatibility).
Write a persistent application using the facilities of Shore and critically
evaluate how well it served your needs, or work to extend or improve
Shore in some way (see me for ideas).


UW--Madison Research Projects:


 Detailed descriptions 
of several of the research projects mentioned above
(and more) are available via the
 CS Department Home Page .
Most of the projects listed there would welcome participation by interested
students.

Tempest

From: markhill@reggiano.cs.wisc.edu (Mark D. Hill)

Date: Mon, 27 Feb 1995 14:36:04 -0600 (CST)

Here is a 736 project that I think would be interesting:

Background: Future parallel computers must execute efficiently both
hand-coded applications and also programs written in high-level
programming languages.  Today's machines limit programs to a single
communication paradigm--message-passing or shared-memory--which results
in uneven performance.  To address this problem, we have developed the
Tempest interface, which supports shared-memory, message-passing, and
hybrid applications.  Tempest enhances portability of parallel programs
by allowing low-cost networks of workstations to provide the same
abstractions (e.g., shared memory) as high-performance parallel machines.

The Tempest interface consists of low-level communication and
memory-system mechanisms.  Policies, such as shared memory, are
implemented in user-level software, which allows programmers and compilers
to customize policies to an application's semantics and sharing patterns.
Experiments show that custom cache coherency policies can produce upto
an order-of-magnitude performance improvement.

The Wisconsin Wind Tunnel Project has
developed implementations of Tempest for the CM-5 and a cluster of
workstations (COW) (Sun SS-20 running Solaris 2.4).  To complete our
portability story and facilitate program development, we would like to see
Tempest run a single workstation (either uniprocessor or multiprocessor).

The project: Implement Tempest so that all processes run on on a single
two-processor node of COW.  The key challenge is implementing the
messaging so that functionally it looks exactly the same as the version
that sends messages between nodes.  

Interested groups should read

the paper

before talking with him further.
