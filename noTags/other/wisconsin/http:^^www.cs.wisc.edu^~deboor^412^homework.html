Assignments for CS 412


Assignments for CS412 (as of 28 october) 
 amplification of rules  
Scientific work is very much based on cooperation, on making use of other
people's work. However, if one presents work under one's own name, one
is honor-bound to list any such sources used.  Failure to do so is called
cheating and results in loss of one's scientific standing (and worse).


 This also applies to homework handed in under one's own name. Specifically,
the instructor has nothing against students cooperating on homework
assignments provided such cooperation is explicitly acknowledged in the
homework handed in and provided the students understand that mere copying
without understanding can only hurt in the exam (not to mention the fact that
it defeats the course's basic goal which is for the students to learn the 
course material).


 assignments  
If you pick up the TeX file of an assignment, be aware of certain
peculiarities: Material between vertical bars within the text is meant to
appear in print in typewriter font, like a matlab expression. It has its
usual meaning of absolute values signs only when it appears in a
math-expression, i.e., within material enclosed in dollar signs.

 policies and comments 

If a problem asks you to carry out some MATLAB calculation, be sure to
hand in a clean and well-commented script which carries out the calculations,
along with a diary (edited to be short and to the point) showing the relevant
answer(s) generated by your script.


Mark all homework clearly with your name. In addition, put the first letter of
your last name boldly into the upper left corner of the first page of your
homework, to make it easier for us to sort it and for you to find it again when
it is handed back.

There will be an assignment every two weeks, and each assignment (except for
the first) is likely to contain three problems, summing up to 65 points, with
5 T/F questions providing an additional 10 points.

 policy on late homework 

 Any homework not handed in by the BEGINNING of the class period of the 
due date loses 10%.
 Any homework not handed in by 5p of the due date loses 25%.

Any homework not handed in by noon of the day after the due date loses 100%.
 To `hand in' homework outside class, put it into the instructor's mailbox
(fifth floor of CS & Stat) or hand it directly to the instructor (if you can
find him :-).
