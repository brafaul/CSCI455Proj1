Running a DOS Window (Changing Your Password)
CS 302: Introduction to Microsoft Windows
Running a DOS Window (Changing Your Password)





DOS windows are unlike other windows in MS Windows.  Most windows use a
graphical user-interface which allows the user to use the mouse.  However,
DOS windows require the user to only use the keyboard to type in commands
at a command prompt.  (You may note that there is no menu bar as there are 
no menus in a DOS window.)


Starting a DOS Window

In order to run a DOS window, you must find the MS-DOS Prompt icon in
the CS Apps program group, and double click on the icon:



You will then have a window appear which looks like:



If you are familiar with MS DOS, then you will know how to use the command
prompt.  If you are not familiar with MS DOS, then we can take this opportunity
to briefly introduce you to it by changing your password.


Changing Your Password

The only thing you need to do with a DOS window in CS 302 (M and P 
sections) is change your password.  At the U:\ prompt, type 
setpass and press the Enter key.  You will then be prompted
for you old password and your new password.  You will also be asked to retype
your new password for verification.



Note: as you type your old and new passwords, nothing will appear on
the screen.  This is done to protect your privacy.  Also, 
capitalization does not matter for your password.


Exiting a DOS Window

To exit a DOS window, simply type EXIT and hit the Enter key:



The entire DOS window should disappear.
