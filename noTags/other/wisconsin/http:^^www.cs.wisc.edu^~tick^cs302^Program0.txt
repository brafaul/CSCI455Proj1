CS 302 Section 70 - Program 0


 Program0


Program0 requires you to do no programming of your own, nor are you required at this point to understand what the program is doing (although it may make a little more sense once you run it). It's simply intended to get you used to using the PC's, MS-DOS, and Microsoft Fortran.

First, if you haven't already, check out the basics of using Fortran on the PC's. Second, you're going to need once additional piece of information: the file prog0.dat (that's prog zero) which program0 needs in the same directory that you run your program in.

Here is the program to type in:

C       Jeff Lampert
C       9/5/96
C       Program 0
C       CS302, Section 70

        PROGRAM ZERO
        IMPLICIT NONE
        CHARACTER NAME*128
        CHARACTER BUFFER*20

        OPEN (UNIT = 1, FILE = 'PROG0.DAT' , STATUS = 'OLD')  

        PRINT *,'Please enter your name: '
        READ '(A)',NAME

2       CONTINUE

           READ(1,4,END=3) BUFFER
4          FORMAT(A)
           PRINT *,BUFFER 
        GOTO 2

3       CONTINUE

        PRINT *, NAME
        CLOSE(UNIT=1)
        STOP
        END
