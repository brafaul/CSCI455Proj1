 CS 733: Instructions to set up MATLAB 


CS 733: Instructions to set up MATLAB
 Introduction 

Most of the assignments for this course will be carried out with the
aid of MATLAB, an interactive package for high performance scientific
computing.  To set up your ``sol'' account to use MATLAB, the
following should be carried out.

If logged in directly to a sol (e.g. sol10) then:

At the unix prompt, immediately after you login, carry out the following:
  

sol10> mkdir matlab
sol10> cp /u/c/s/cs733-1/public/startup.m  ~/matlab/startup.m
sol10> xterm -g 80x40 -e matlab &


The last command should set up a separate window from in which matlab
is running.  You can then use your favourite editor in the login
window to create any `m' files that you might need for your work.  All
the `m' files that are created by the instructor as well as the
homework and project data files in the public directory:


  /u/c/s/cs733-1/public  

  
are now available to you for use in MATLAB. 

For all homework assignments you should hand in your results produced 
as follows:
 

sol10> matlab
>> diary hwk1.lst
>> load hwk1 
>> .....whatever homework 1 requires 
>> diary off
>> exit
sol10> print hwk1.lst

Remote Unix Machine Users

Suppose that the machine you are logged on is not a sol, but is called
cheddar.  On a cheddar window you do the following:


cheddar> xhost +sol10



In the sol10 window on cheddar:


sol10> setenv DISPLAY cheddar:0
sol10> matlab
