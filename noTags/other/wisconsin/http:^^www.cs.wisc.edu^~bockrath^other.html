Nate's Other Neat Stuff


 
Day 7654: My tormentors continue to torture me with dangling objects.  They tease me by eating good food in front of me, and then feeding me some smelly dried cereal and water.  My only pleasure comes from destroying their furniture, and climbing u

p their drapes.  My fellow captives have it much worse, however.  He is dangled in a cage which hangs from a post.  All they feed him are seeds. His screaming seems to please them, but I can't stand it anymore.  Please, let release come...
