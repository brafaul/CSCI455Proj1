While reading you should always do the self-test exercises, and read
the summary sections.  Always do the assigned reading before class.
That is, you should read each week's assignment before the Tuesday of that
week.    

Quizzes will be on Thursdays unless otherwise noted.  Exams will be
held on Tuesday or Wednesday eventings.  
We will try to establish the place and time
roughly two weeks before the exam. The final is on Tuesday Dec 17,
1996 at 5:50pm.  Mark your calendar.
