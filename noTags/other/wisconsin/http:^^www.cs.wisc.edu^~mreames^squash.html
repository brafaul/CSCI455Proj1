The Squash Page



Welcome to my squash page!

Among right-thinking people, squash is, well, the game of choice.  Don't
just take my word for it -- the University of Wisconsin has a thriving squash club.  Take a look!

Rules of Singles Squash
Probably more than you ever wanted to know ...

Some internet squash links

 US Squash
Sponsored by the USSRA, this page has some really good links.
 The Tell-Tale
A squash newsletter from the New Mexico Squash Racquets association.
Good tip of the week!
Internet Squash Federation
Lots of information (this is where I found the document containing the
rules of squash), but sometimes sorta slow (based in UK).
List of US squash clubs

My recent (and
not-so-recent) tournament results
Most people probably wouldn't call attention to a record like this ... :-)

Martin's Brief Squash FAQ
Isn't squash just like racquetball, but ...?
Yeah, and Windows 95 would be a quality, secure operating system,
except that Microsoft wrote it.

Admittedly racquetball provides a small degree of primitive
satisfaction, has a fun bouncy ball, and anyone above age 5 can play.
Squash, on the other hand, requires so much more in the way of tactics,
skill, athletic ability, and endurance, that the two cannot fairly be
compared.

If you need more convincing, read this article from the October 21st-27th,
1995 The Economist entitled: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST



Acknowledgements

At this point I'd like to state that I've stolen pretty much all of this
page's material (except this whiny little bit here) from my friend Tad
Fox's squash page.  Tad was recently a graduate student in Chemistry at U
of Michigan, but has moved on to work at a software company, so his web
pages are no longer available.  To my knowledge.  That's how I rationalize
my theft -- without my intervention, all of his hard work might have gone
for naught.  Heh.
