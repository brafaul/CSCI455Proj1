 Short-term Scheduling 




 Implementing Processes 

We presented processes from the ``user's'' point of view bottom-up:
starting with the process concept, then introducing semaphores as
a way of synchronizing processes, and finally adding a higher-level
synchronization facility in the form of monitors.
We will now explain how to implement these things in the opposite order,
starting with monitors, and finishing with the mechanism for making
processes run.

Tanenbaum makes a big deal out of showing that various synchronization
primitives are equivalent to each other (Section 2.2.9).
While this is true, it kind of misses the point.
It is easy to implement semaphores with monitors (as you saw in the
first part of Project 2), but that's not the
way it usually works.  Normally, semaphores (or something very like
them) are implemented using lower level facilities, and then they
are used to implement monitors.

  Implementing Monitors  

Assuming that all we have is semaphores, and we would rather have monitors.
We will assume that our semaphores have an extra operation, beyond the the
standards operations up and down:
If s is a semaphore, s.awaited() returns true if
any processes are currently waiting for the semaphore.
This feature is not normally provided with semaphores because a race
condition limits its usefulness:
By the time s.awaited() returns true, some other process may have
done s.up(), making it false.
It so happens that this is not a problem for the way we will use semaphores
to implement monitors.

Since monitors are a language feature, they are implemented with the
help of a compiler.
In response to the keywords monitor, condition, signal,
wait, and notify, the compiler inserts little bits of code
here and there in the program.
We will not worry about how the compiler manages to do that, but only
concern ourselves with what the code is and how it works.

The monitor keyword says that there should be mutual exclusion
between the methods of the monitor class (the effect is similar to
making every method a synchronized method in Java).
Thus the compiler creates a semaphore mutex initialized to 1 and adds

    muxtex.down();

to the head of each method.  It also adds a chunk of code that we
call exit (described below) to each place where a method may return--at
the end of the procedure, at each return statement, at each point where
an exception may be thrown, at each place where a goto might leave the
procedure (if the language has gotos), etc.  Finding all these return
points can be tricky in complicated procedures, which is why we want the
compiler to help us out.

When a process signals or notifies a condition variable
on which some other process is waiting, we have a problem:
We can't both of the processes immediately continue, since that would
violate the cardinal rule that there may never be more than one process
active in methods of the same monitor object at the same time.
Thus we must block one of the processes:  the signaller in the case
of signal and the waiter in the case of notify
We call this semaphore highPriority since processes blocked on
it are given preference over processes blocked on mutex trying
to get in ``form the outside.''
The highPriority semaphore is initialized to zero.

Each condition variable c becomes a semaphore c_sem
initialized to zero, and c.wait() becomes

    if (highPriority.awaited())
        highPriority.up();
    else
        mutex.up();
    c_sem.down();

Before a process blocks on a condition variable, it lets some other
process go ahead, preferably one waiting on the highPriority
semaphore.

The operation c.signal() becomes

    if (c_sem.awaited()) {
        c_sem.up();
        highPriority.down();
    }

Notice that a signal of a condition that is not awaited has
no effect, and that a signal of a condition that is awaited
immediately blocks the signaller.

Finally, the code for exit which is placed at every return point, is

    if (highPriority.awaited())
        highPriority.up();
    else
        mutex.up();

Note that this is the same code as for c.wait(), except for the
final c_sem.down().

In systems that use notify (such as Java), c.notify() is
replaced by

    if (c_sem.awaited()
        c_sem.up();

In these systems, the code for c.wait() also has to be modified
to wait on the highPriority semaphore after getting the semaphore
associated with the condition:

    if (highPriority.awaited())
        highPriority.up();
    else
        mutex.up();
    c_sem.down();
    highPriority.down();

No system offers both signal and notify.

This generic implementation of monitors can be optimized in special cases.
First, note that a process that exits the monitor immediately after
doing a signal need not wait on the highPriority semaphore.
This turns out to be a very common occurrence, so it's worth optimizing
for this special case.
If signal is only allowed just before a return, 
the implementation can be further simplified:
See Fig 2-16 on page 53 of Tanenbaum.
Finally, note that we do not use the full generality of semaphores in
this implementation of monitors.
The semaphore mutex only takes on the values 0 and 1 (it is a
so-called binary semaphore) and the other semaphores never
have any value other than zero.

  Implementing Semaphores  

A simple-minded attempt to implement semaphores might look like this:

    class Semaphore {
        private int value;
        Semaphore(int v) { value = v; }
        public void down() {
            while (value == 0) {}
            value--;
        }
        public void up() {
            value++;
        }
    }

There are two things wrong with this solution:
First, as we have seen before, attempts to manipulate a shared variable without
synchronization can lead to incorrect results, even
if the manipulation is as simple as value++.
If we had monitors, we could make the modifications of value atomic
by making the class into a monitor (or by making each method
synchronized), but remember that monitors are implemented with
semaphores, so we have to implement semaphores with something even more
primitive.
For now, we will assume that we have critical sections:
If we bracket a section of code with begin_cs and end_cs,

    begin_cs
        do something;
    end_cs

the code will execute atomically, as if it were protected by a semaphore

    mutex.down();
        do something;
    mutex.up();

where mutex is a semaphore initialized to 1.
Of course, we can't actually use a semaphore to implement semaphores!
We will show how to implement begin_cs and end_cs in the
next section.

The other problem with our implementation of semaphores is that it
includes a busy wait.
While Semaphore.down() is waiting for value to become
non-zero, it is looping, continuously testing the value.
Even if the waiting process is running on its own CPU, this busy waiting
may slow down other processes, since it is repeatedly accessing shared memory,
thus interfering with accesses to that memory by other CPU's (a shared memory
unit can only respond to one CPU at a time).
If there is only one CPU, the problem is even worse:
Because the process calling down() is running, another process that
wants to call up() may not get a chance to run.
What we need is some way to put a process to sleep.
If we had semaphores, we could use a semaphore, but once again, we need
something more primitive.

For now, let us assume that there is a data structure called a PCB
(short for ``Process Control Block'') that contains information about a
process, and a procedure swap_process that takes a pointer to a PCB as
an argument.
When swap_process(pcb) is called, state of the currently running process
(the one that called swap_process) is saved in pcb and the CPU
starts running the process whose state was previously stored in pcb
instead.
Given begin_cs, end_cs, and swap_process, the
complete implementation of semaphores is quite simple (but very subtle!).

    class Semaphore {
        private PCB_queue waiters;    // processes waiting for this Semaphore
        private int value;            // if negative, number of waiters

        static PCB_queue ready_list;  // list of all processes ready to run

        Semaphore(int v) { value = v; }

        public void down() {
            begin_cs
                value--;
                if (value < 0) {
                    // The current process must wait

                    // Find some other process to run.  The ready_list must
                    // be non-empty or there is a global deadlock.
                    PCB pcb = ready_list.dequeue();

                    swap_process(pcb);

                    // Now pcb contains the state of the process that called
                    // down(), and the currently running process is some
                    // other process.
                    waiters.enqueue(pcb);
                }
            end_cs
        }
        public void up() {
            begin_cs
                value++;
                if (value <= 0) {
                    // The value was previously negative, so there is
                    // some process waiting.  We must wake it up.
                    PCB pcb = waiters.dequeue();
                    ready_list.enqueue(pcb);
                }
            end_cs
        }
    } // Semaphore

The implementation of swap_process is ``magic'':

    /* This procedure is probably really written in assembly language,
     * but we will describe it in Java.  Assume the CPU's current
     * stack-pointer register is accessible as "SP".
     */
    void swap_process(PCB pcb) {
        int new_sp = pcb.saved_sp;
        pcb.saved_sp = SP;
        SP = new_sp;
    }

As we mentioned
earlier,
each process has its own stack with a stack frame for
each procedure that process has called but not yet completed.
Each stack frame contains, at the very least, enough information
to implement a return from the procedure:
the address of the instruction that called the procedure, and a pointer
to the caller's stack frame.
Each CPU devotes one of its registers (call it SP) to point to
the current stack frame of the process it is currently running.
When the CPU encounters a return statement, it reloads its
SP and PC (program counter) registers from the stack frame.
An approximate description in pseudo-Java might be something like this.

    class StackFrame {
        int callers_SP;
        int callers_PC;
    }
    StackFrame SP;    // the current stack pointer

    // Here's how to do a "return"
    instruction_address return_point = SP.callers_PC;
    SP = SP.callers_SP;
    goto return_point;

(of course, there isn't really a goto statement in Java, and this
would all be done in the hardware or a sequence of assembly language
statements).

Suppose process P0 calls swap_process(pcb), where
pcb.saved_sp points to a stack frame representing a call of
swap_process by some other process P1.
The call to swap_process creates a frame on P0's stack
and makes SP point to it.
The second statement of swap_process saves a pointer to that stack
frame in pcb.
The third statement then loads SP with a pointer to P1's
stack frame for swap_process.
Now, when the procedure returns, it will be a return to whatever
procedure called swap_process in process P1.
    
  Implementing Critical Sections  

The final piece in the puzzle is to implement begin_cs and
end_cs.
There are several ways of doing this, depending on the hardware
configuration.
First suppose there are multiple CPU's accessing a single shared memory
unit.
Generally, the memory or bus hardware serializes requests to
read and write memory words.
For example, if two CPU's try to write different values to the same
memory word at the same time, the net result will be one of the two values,
not some combination of the values.
Similarly, if one CPU tries to read a memory word at the same time another
modifies it, the read will return either the old or new value--it will not
see a ``half-changed'' memory location.
Surprisingly, that is all the hardware support we need to implement
critical sections.

The first solution to this problem was discovered by the Dutch mathematician
T. Dekker.
A simpler solution was later discovered by Gary Peterson.
Peterson's solution looks deceptively simple.
To see how tricky the problem is, let us look at a couple of simpler-- but
incorrect--solutions.
For now, we will assume there are only two processes, P0 and P1.
The first idea is to have the processes take turns.

    shared int turn;             // 1 or 2, depending on 
    void begin_cs(int i) {       // process i's version of begin_cs
        while (turn != i) { /* do nothing */ }
    }
    void end_cs(int i) {         // process i's version of end_cs
        turn = 1 - i;            // give the other process a chance.
    }

This solution is certainly safe, in that it never allows both
processes to be in their critical sections at the same time.
The problem with this solution is that it is not live.
If process P0 wants to enter its critical section and turn == 1,
it will have to wait until process P1 decides to enter and then
leave its critical section.
Since we will only used critical sections to protect short operations
(see the implementation of semaphores
above), it is reasonable to assume that
a process that has done begin_cs will soon do end_CS,
but the converse is not true:  There's no reason to assume that the
other process will want to enter its critical section any time in the
near future (or even at all!).

To get around this problem, a second attempt to solve the problem uses
a shared array critical to indicate which processes are in
their critical sections.

    shared boolean critical[] = { false, false };
    void begin_cs(int i) {
        critical[i] = true;
        while (critical[1 - i]) { /* do nothing */ }
    }
    void end_cs(int i) {
        critical[i] = false;
    }

This solution is unfortunately prone to deadlock.
If both processes set their critical flags to true at
the same time, they will each loop forever, waiting for the other
process to go ahead.
If we switch the order of the statements in begin_cs, the solution
becomes unsafe.
Both processes could check each other's critical states at the same
time, see that they were false, and enter their critical sections.
Finally, if we change the code to

    void begin_cs(int i) {
        critical[i] = true;
        while (critical[1 - i]) {
            critical[i] = false;
            /* perhaps sleep for a while */
            critical[i] = true;
        }
    }

livelock can occur.
The processes can get into a loop in which each process sets its own
critical flag, notices that the other critical flag is
true, clears its own critical flag, and repeats.

Peterson's (correct) solution combines ideas from both of these attempts.
Like the second ``solution,'' each process signals its desire to enter
its critical section by setting a shared flag.
Like the first ``solution,'' it uses a turn variable, but it
only uses it to break ties.

    shared int turn;
    shared boolean critical[] = { false, false };
    void begin_cs(int i) {
        critical[i] = true;     // let other guy know I'm trying
        turn = 1 - i;           // be nice: let him go first
        while (
            critical[j-1]  // the other guy is trying
            && turn != i   // and he has precedence
        ) { /* do nothing */ }
    }
    void end_cs(int i) {
        critical[i] = false;    // I'm done now
        
    }


Peterson's solution, while correct, has some drawbacks.
First, it employs a busy wait (sometimes called a spin lock)
which is bad for reasons suggested above.
However, if critical sections are only used to protect very short
sections of code, such as the down and up operations on
semaphores as above, this isn't too bad a problem.
Two processes will only rarely attempt to enter their critical sections
at the same time, and even then, the loser will only have to ``spin'' for
a brief time.
A more serious problem is that Peterson's solution only works for two processes.
Next, we present three solutions that work for arbitrary numbers of
processes.

Most computers have additional hardware features that make the
critical section easier to solve.
One such feature is a ``test and set'' instruction that sets a memory location
to a given value and at the same time records in the CPU's unshared
state information about the location's previous value.
For example, the old value might be loaded into a register, or
a condition code might be set to indicate whether the old value was zero.
Tanenbaum presents in Fig 2-9 on page 39 a solution using test-and-set.
Here is a version using Java-like syntax

    shared boolean lock = false;    // true if any process is in its CS
    void begin_cs() {               // same for all processes
        for (;;) {
            boolean key = testAndSet(lock);
            if (!key)
                return;
        }
    }
    void end_cs() {
        lock = false;
    }

Some other computers have a swap instruction that swaps the
value in a register with the contents of a shared memory word.

    shared boolean lock = false;    // true if any process is in its CS
    void begin_cs() {               // same for all processes
        boolean key = true;
        for (;;) {
            swap(key, lock)
            if (!key)
                return;
        }
    }
    void end_cs() {
        boolean key = false;
        swap(key, lock)
    }


The problem with both of these solutions is that they do not necessarily
prevent starvation.
If several processes try to enter their critical sections at the same time,
only one will succeed (safety) and the winner will be chosen in a bounded
amount of time (liveness), but the winner is chosen essentially randomly,
and there is nothing to prevent one process from winning all the time.
The ``bakery algorithm'' of Leslie Lamport solves this problem.
When a process wants to get service, it takes a ticket.
The process with the lowest numbered ticket is served first.
The process id's are used to break ties.

    static final int N = ...;         // number of processes

    shared boolean choosing[] = { false, false, ..., false };
    shared int ticket[] = { 0, 0, ..., 0 };

    void begin_cs(int i) {
        choosing[i] = true;
        ticket[i] = 1 + max(ticket[0], ..., ticket[N-1]);
        choosing[i] = false;
        for (int j=0; j<N; j++) {
            while (choosing[j]) { /* nothing */ }
            while (ticket[j] != 0
                && (
                    ticket[j] < ticket[i]
                    || (ticket[j] == ticket[i] && j < i)
                ) { /* nothing */ }
        }
    }
    void end_cs(int i) {
        ticket[i] = 0;
    }


Finally, we note that all of these solutions to the critical-section
problem assume multiple CPU's sharing one memory.
If there is only one CPU, we cannot afford to busy-wait.
However, the good news is that we don't have to.
All we have to do is make sure that the short-term scheduler (to be
discussed in the next section) does not switch processes while
a process is in a critical section.
One way to do this is simply to block interrupts.
Most computers have a way of preventing interrupts from occurring.
It can be dangerous to block interrupts for an extended period of time,
but it's fine for very short critical sections, such as the ones used
to implement semaphores.
Note that a process that blocks on a semaphore does not need mutual exclusion
the whole time it's blocked; the critical section is only long enough to
decide whether to block.

  Short-term Scheduling  

Earlier, we called a process
that is not blocked ``runnable'' and said that a runnable process is either
ready or running.
In general, there is a list of runnable processes called the ready
list.
Each CPU picks a process from the ready list and runs
it until it blocks.
It then chooses another process to run, and so on.
The implementation of semaphores
above illustrates this.
This switching among runnable processes is called short-term
scheduling1, and the algorithm that
decides which process to run and how long to run it is called a short-term
scheduling policy or discipline.
Some policies are preemptive, meaning that the CPU may switch
processes even when the current process isn't blocked.

Before we look at various scheduling policies, it is worthwhile to 
think about what we are trying to accomplish.
There is a tension between maximizing overall efficiency and giving
good service to individual ``customers.''
From the system's point of view, two important measures are

Throughput.
The amount of useful work accomplished per unit time.
This depends, of course, on what constitutes ``useful work.''
One common measure of throughput is jobs/minute (or second, or hour,
depending on the kinds of job).
Utilization.
For each device, the utilization of a device is the fraction
of time the device is busy.
A good scheduling algorithm keeps all the devices (CPU's, disk drives, etc.)
busy most of the time.

Both of these measures depend not only on the scheduling algorithm, but
also on the offered load.
If load is very light--jobs arrive only infrequently--both throughput
and utilization will be low.
However, with a good scheduling algorithm, throughput should increase
linearly with load until the available hardware is saturated and throughput
levels off.




Each ``job''2 also wants good service.
In general, ``good service'' means good response:
It is starts quickly, runs quickly, and finishes quickly.
There are several ways of measuring response:

Turnaround.
The length of time between when the job arrives in the system and when
it finally finishes.
Response Time.
The length of time between when the job arrives in the system and when
it starts to produce output.
For interactive jobs, response time might be more important than turnaround.
Waiting Time.
The amount of time the job is ready (runnable but not running).
This is a better measure of scheduling quality than turnaround, since
the scheduler has no control of the amount of time the process spends
computing or blocked waiting for I/O.
Penalty Ratio.
Elapsed time divided by the sum of the CPU and I/O demands of the
the job.
This is a still better measure of how well the scheduler is doing.
It measures how many times worse the turnaround is than it would be
in an ``ideal'' system.
If the job never had to wait for another job, could allocate each I/O device
as soon as it wants it, and experienced no overhead for other operating
system functions, it would have a penalty ratio of 1.0.
If it takes twice as long to complete as it would in the perfect system,
it has a penalty ration of 2.0.

To measure the overall performance, we can then combine the performance
of all jobs using any one of these measures and any way of combining.
For example, we can compute average waiting time as the average
of waiting times of all jobs.
Similarly, we could calculate the sum of the waiting times, the
average penalty ratio, the variance in response time, etc.
There is some evidence that a high variance in response time can be
more annoying to interactive users than a high mean (within reason).

Since we are concentrating on short-term (CPU) scheduling, one useful
way to look at a process is as a sequence of bursts.
Each burst is the computation done by a process between the time
it becomes ready and the next time it blocks.
To the short-term scheduler, each burst looks like a tiny ``job.''
First-Come-First-Served

The simplest possible scheduling discipline is called First-come,
first-served (FCFS).
The ready list is a simple queue (first-in/first-out).
The scheduler simply runs the first job on the queue until it blocks, then
it runs the new first job, and so on.
When a job becomes ready, it is simply added to the end of the queue.

Here's an example, which we will use to illustrate all the scheduling
disciplines.



Burst    Arrival Time    Burst Length

A    0    3

B    1    5

C    3    2

D    9    5

E    12    5


(All times are in milliseconds).
The following Gantt chart shows the schedule that results from
FCFS scheduling.




The main advantage of FCFS is that it is easy to write and understand, but
it has some severe problems.
If one process gets into an infinite loop, it will run forever and
shut out all the others.
Even if we assume that processes don't have infinite loops (or take
special precautions to catch such processes), FCFS tends to excessively favor
long bursts.
Let's compute the waiting time and penalty ratios for these jobs.



Burst Start Time Finish Time Waiting Time Penalty Ratio

A    0    3    0    1.0

B    3    8    2    1.4

C    8    10    5    3.5

D    10    15    1    1.2

E    15    20    3    1.6

Average      2.2    1.74


As you can see, the shorted burst (C) has the worst penalty ratio.
The situation can be much worse if a short burst arrives after a very
long one.  For example, suppose a burst of length 100 arrives at time
0 and a burst of length 1 arrives immediately after it, at time 1.
The first burst doesn't have to wait at all, so its penalty ratio is
1.0 (perfect), but the second burst waits 99 milliseconds, for a penalty
ratio of 99.

Favoring long bursts means favoring
CPU-bound processes (which have very long CPU bursts between
I/O operations).
In general, we would like to favor I/O-bound processes, since if we
give the CPU to an I/O-bound process, it will quickly finish its burst,
start doing some I/O, and get out of the ready list.
Consider what happens if we have one CPU-bound process and several I/O-bound
processes.
Suppose we start out on the right foot and run the I/O-bound processes
first.
They will all quickly finish their bursts and go start their I/O operations,
leaving us to run the CPU-bound job.
After a while, they will finish their I/O and queue up behind the CPU-bound
job, leaving all the I/O devices idle.
When the CPU-bound job finishes its burst, it will start an I/O operation,
allowing us to run the other jobs.
As before, they will quickly finish their bursts and start to do I/O.
Now we have the CPU sitting idle, while all the processes are doing I/O.
Since the CPU hog started its I/O first, it will likely finish first,
grabbing the CPU and making all the other processes wait.
The system will continue this way, alternating between periods when the
CPU is busy and all the I/O devices are idle with periods when the CPU
is idle and all the processes are doing I/O.
We have destroyed one of the main motivations for having processes in
the first place:
to allow overlap between computation with I/O.
This phenomenon is called the convoy effect.

In summary, although FCFS is simple, it performs poorly in terms of
global performance measures, such as CPU utilization and throughput.
It also gives lousy response to interactive jobs (which tend to be
I/O bound).
The one good thing about FCFS is that there is no starvation:
Every burst does get served, if it waits long enough.
Shortest-Job-First

A much better policy is called shortest-job-first (SJF).
Whenever the CPU has to choose a burst to run, it chooses the
shortest one.
(The algorithm really should be called ``shortest burst first'', but
the name SJF is traditional).
This policy certainly gets around all the problems with FCFS mentioned
above.  In fact, we can prove the SJF is optimal with
respect to average waiting time.
That is, any other policy whatsoever will have worse average waiting time.
By decreasing average waiting time, we also improve processor utilization
and throughput.

Here's the proof that SJF is optimal.
Suppose we have a set of bursts ready to run and we run them in some
order other than SJF.
Then there must be some burst that is run before shorter burst, say
b1 is run before
b2, but
b1 >
b1.
If we reversed the order, we would increase the waiting time of
b1 by
b2, but decrease the waiting time of
b2 by 
b1.
Since
b1 >
b1, we have a net decrease in total, and hence average,
waiting time.
Continuing in this manner to move shorter bursts ahead of longer ones,
we eventually end up with the bursts sorted in increasing order of size
(think of this as a bubble sort!).

Here's our previous example with SJF scheduling



Burst Start Time Finish Time Waiting Time Penalty Ratio

A    0    3    0    1.0

B    5    10    4    1.4

C    3    5    0    1.0

D    10    15    1    1.2

E    15    20    3    1.6

Average      1.6    1.24


Here's the Gantt chart:




As described, SJF is a non-preemptive policy.
There is also a preemptive version of the SJF, which is sometimes called
shortest-remaining-time-first (SRTF).
Whenever a new job enters the ready queue, the algorithm reconsiders which job
to run.
If the new arrival has a burst shorter than the remaining
portion of the current burst, the scheduler moves the current job back
to the ready queue (to the appropriate position considering the remaining
time in its burst) and runs the new arrival instead.

With SJF or SRTF, starvation is possible.
A very long burst may never get run, because shorter bursts keep arriving
in the ready queue.
We will return to this problem later.

There's only one problem with SJF (or SRTF):
We don't know how long a burst is going to be until we run it!
Luckily, we can make a pretty good guess.
Processes tend to be creatures of habit, so if one burst of a process
is long, there's a good chance the next burst will be long as well.
Thus we might guess that each burst will be the
same length as the previous burst of the same process.
However, that strategy won't work so well if a process has an occasional
oddball burst that unusually long or short burst.
Not only will we get that burst wrong, we will guess wrong on the next burst,
which is more typical for the process.
A better idea is to make each guess the average of the length
of the immediately preceding burst and the guess we used before that
burst:
guess = (guess + previous_burst)/2.
This strategy takes into account the entire past history of a process
in guessing the next burst length, but it quickly adapts to changes
in the behavior of the process, since the ``weight'' of each burst
in computing the guess drops off exponentially with the time since that
burst.
If we call the most recent burst length b1, the
one before that b2, etc., then the next guess is
b1/2 + b2/4 + b4/8 + b8/16 +
....
Round-Robin and Processor Sharing

Another scheme for preventing long bursts from getting too much priority
is a preemptive strategy called round-robin (RR).
RR keeps all the burst in a queue and runs the first one, like FCFS.
But after a length of time q (called a quantum), if the
current burst hasn't completed, it is moved to the tail of the queue
and the next burst is started.
Here are Gantt charts of our example with round-robin and quantum sizes
of 4 and 1.



With q = 4, we get an average waiting time of 3.6 and an average
penalty ratio of 1.98 (work it out yourself!).
With q = 1, the averages drop to 3.2 and 1.88, respectively.
The limit, as q approaches zero, is called processor sharing
(PS).
PS causes the CPU to be shared equally among all the ready processes.
In the steady state of PS, when no bursts enter or leave the ready list,
each burst sees a penalty ratio of exactly n,
the length of the ready queue.
Of course PS is only of theoretical interest.  There is a substantial
overhead in switching from one process to another.  If the quantum is
too small, the CPU will spend most its time switching between processes
and practically none of it actually running them!
Priority Scheduling

There are a whole family of scheduling algorithms that use priorities.
The basic idea is always to run the highest priority burst.
Priority algorithms can be preemptive or non-preemptive (if a burst arrives
that has higher priority than the currently running burst, does do we
switch to it immediately, or do we wait until the current burst finishes?).
Priorities can be assigned externally to processes based on their
importance.  They can also be assigned (and changed) dynamically.
For example, priorities can be used to prevent starvation:  If we raise the
priority of a burst the longer it has been in the ready queue, eventually
it will have the highest priority of all ready burst and be guaranteed
a chance to finish.
One interesting use of priority is sometimes called multi-level feedback
queues (MLFQ).
We maintain a sequence of FIFO queues, numbered starting at zero.
New bursts are added to the tail of queue 0.
We always run the burst at the head of the lowest numbered non-empty
queue.
If it doesn't complete in complete within a specified time limit,
it is moved to the tail of the next higher queue.
Each queue has its own time limit:
one unit in queue 0, two units in queue 1, four units in queue 2,
eight units in queue 3, etc.
This scheme combines many of the best features of the other algorithms:
It favors short bursts, since they will be completed while they
are still in low-numbered (high priority) queues.
Long bursts, on the other hand, will be run with comparatively few
expensive process switches.

This idea can be generalized.
Each queue can have its own scheduling discipline, and you can use any
criterion you like to move bursts from queue to queue.
There's no end to the number of algorithms you can dream up.
Analysis

It is possible to analyze some of these algorithms mathematically.
There is a whole branch of computer science called ``queuing theory''
concerned with this sort of analysis.
Usually, the analysis uses statistical assumptions.
For example, it is common to assume that the arrival of new bursts is
Poisson:  The expected time to wait until the next new
burst arrives is independent of how long it has been since the last
burst arrived.  In other words, the amount of time that has passed since
the last arrival is no clue to how long it will be until the next
arrival.  You can show that in this case, the probability of an arrival
in the next t milliseconds is1 - e-at,
where a is a parameter called the arrival rate.
The average time between arrivals is 1/a.
Another common assumption is that the burst lengths follow a similar
``exponential'' distribution:  the probability that the length of a burst
is less than t is 1 - e-bt, where b
is another parameter, the service rate.
The average burst length is b.
This kind of system is called an ``M/M/1 queue.''

The ratio p = a/b is of particular
interest:3
If p > 1, burst are arriving, on the average, faster than
they are finishing, so the ready queue grows without bound.
(Of course, that can't happen because there is at most one burst per
process, but this is theory!)
If p = 1, arrivals and departures are perfectly balanced.

It can be shown that for FCFS, the average penalty ratio for
bursts of length t is

P(t) = 1 + p / [ (1-p)bt ] 

As you can see, as t decreases, the penalty ratio increases,
proving that FCFS doesn't like short bursts.
Also note that as p approaches one, the penalty ration approaches
infinity.

For processor sharing, as we noticed above, all processes have a penalty
ratio that is the length of the queue.
It can be shown that on the average, that length is 1/(1-p).



1We will see medium-term and long-term scheduling later
in the course.

2A job might be a batch job (such as printing a run of paychecks),
an interactive login session, or a command issued by an interactive session.
It might consist of a single process or a group of related processes.

3Actually, a, b, and p are supposed
to be the Greek letters ``alpha,'' ``beta,'' and ``rho,'' but I can't figure
out how to make them in HTML.
