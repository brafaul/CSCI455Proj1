Lecture Notes for CS 537



I will use these note in the lectures for CS537.
You should print out each week's lectures and review the notes before
class.
Bring these to class so that you won't have to spend as much time during
lecture writing.

This is the first semester that I am using the Web to distribute my notes.
That means that I have to convert them from another word processing package,
so not all of the notes will be ready at the start of the semester.
I will announce in class when new sections are ready.

Note: sections marked with a "*" are not yet ready.
You will get unpredictable output if you view or print them.
