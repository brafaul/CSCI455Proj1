CS 302 Section 70 - Quiz 1


Quiz #1

Note: This was a more difficult quiz than I'd originally intended. Don't worry if you had some problems with this one; that'll be taken into account when the semester's over.

Suppose that inside you computer, the variable FUBAR has the binary value 01100011. What is its decimal value if FUBAR is declared as
a) INTEGER

---------------------------------
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1  |      = 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 99
--------------------------------- 
 2^7 2^6 2^5 2^4 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0



b) REAL (4 digit mantissa, 4 digit exponent)

  0110     0011 is

1.0110 x 2^0011       = [2^0 + 2^(-2) + 2^(-3)] x 2^3 = 11.0



Find one type of each error (syntax,semantic,run-time,logical)
(assume no line-position problems) 

	PROGRAM SPAM
	IMPLICIT NONE

C	Number of Eggs, Sausage, Beans, Spam
C	Vikings, Dead Frogs, And Health Code Violations 
	INTEFER EGGS,SAUSAG,BEANS,SPAM
	INTEGER VIKING,DDFROG,HEALTH

	EGGS = 40
	SAUSAG = 200
	BEANS = 100
	SPAM = 20000
	EDIBLE = EGGS + SAUSAG + BEANS + SPAM

	VIKING = 20
	DDFROG = 0
	HEALTH = 300

	PRINT *,'Edible Food per Viking', VIKING/EDIBLE
	PRINT *,'(crunchy) Dead Frogs per Viking',DDFROG/VIKING
	PRINT *,'Health violations per dead frog',HEALTH/DDFROG
	
	STOP
	END


a) Syntax Error:
    INTEFER instead of INTEGER on line 6

b) Semantic Error:
    EDIBLE undeclared

c) Run-Time Error:
    HEALTH/DDFROG is dividing by 0

d) Logical Error:
    Edible food per dead vikingshould be EDIBLE/VIKING (not VIKING/EDIBLE)

What would be the value of FUBAR after the following statements:
a) 
CHARACTER*3 FUBAR
FUBAR = 'CONGRESS'

Only the first three characters can be stored, so FUBAR = 'CON'


b) 
INTEGER FUBAR
FUBAR = 3.6

Integers truncate, so FUBAR = 3


c) 
INTEGER FUBAR
FUBAR = MOD(18,5)

The remainder of 18 when divied by 5 is 3.


d) (Hint: Remember the conversion rules)
REAL FUBAR
INTEGER X,Y
FUBAR = 5/3

5 and 3 are integers, so the expression 5/3 = 1
*Then* we convert to the type of FUBAR, so FUBAR = 1.0
(Note: to avoid this, you need something like REAL(5)/3, or 5.0/3
(one operand must be real).
