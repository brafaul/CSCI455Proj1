 CS 132 lab 321 Grades


Grades for CS 132, Section 321 (8-9:15pm TR) 

Look up your grade by the last 4 digits of your ID.




 Notes:
 "Current Full" lists the perfect scroe (i.e., all labs, quizzes, 
and exams are full score). Here I assume that your grades for 
quiz 4 and the rest of the lab assignments are the same as your 
current average quiz and lab grades, resp. 
 The full score for the midterm exam is 89. 
Your scores are shown in their actual values (i.e., out of 89).
On the other hand, the max, min, avg, and median for the exam
are shown normalized (i.e., multiplied by 100/89).
