Lots of pictures...

 Here we are at the Ferrari factory in Modena, Italy
during our excursion to ISCA-22.  Pictured from left to right is
Babak Falsafi,
Scott Breach,
T.N. Vijaykumar,
me,
and Rob Pfile.

 This is Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy.  A
beautiful city on the Italian riviera where ISCA-22 was held.

 Again in Italy -- this picture was taken in Florence
atop El Duomo.

 Here's my two wonderful kids.  Katie (2 years) is
on the left and Nicholas (4 years) is on the right.  Katie loves to climb and
tease Nicholas.  Nicholas is into all sports.  They are both budding hackers!

 Here's Katie and Nicholas again, I told you she likes
to bug Nicholas...  Fortunately for Katie, her *big* brother is a very good
sport.

 Here's a picture of mom (Emily) and Nicholas.
