Preparing for Test & Quizzes in 302-11&13  




Gettin' Ready for a Quizzes and Tests



If you would like to be as ready as possible for any quizzes or
tests that we have, check here for example problems and/or problems
from the book that I feel will be helpful.  Indeed, this could never
be comprehensive, so just realize that it is here just to help guide
you as you prepare.  Also, be aware that anything in the reading,
anything from the lectures, and anything posted on our own web
pages (the things in Stuff For, From, and About Class)
is viable material for a test or quiz.
I'll try to make this information available about a week in 
advance.
