Some Information About Me




A Little About Me

I'm originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Milwaukee's claim to
fame lies in having the most bars per capita in the nation. I
suppose that's not surprising, as the city has several breweries.
I attended the University of
Wisconsin-Madison as an undergraduate, and double-majored in Computer Science and Economics with Math Emphasis.
Somehow, I decided that four years of torture weren't enough. So,
I'm currently a graduate student in computer science, still
attending Madison. I wonder about my decision to stay in Madison
sometimes, especially during the brutal Wisconsin winters. Ah, I
could have gone to California instead!
After a summer internship with Intel
Corporation in Hillsboro, Oregon, I'm back in Madison to
finish my Master's in computer science.
