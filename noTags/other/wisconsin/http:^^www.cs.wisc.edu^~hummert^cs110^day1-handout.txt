Welcome to CS110.  In this class, all documentation, including class
information, assignments, and the syllabus, will be available
``on-line'' only.  
You will be responsible for reading the on-line information; I will
announce when there is something new for you to read.  This document
is prepared to get you started so that you can access the on-line
information.  Fortunately, it's not so difficult, so you shouldn't
have any trouble.

By ``on-line'' documents I mean information that is accessible using
the computers in the CS110 lab.  This information is available via the
World Wide Web, or WWW, which is a system for browsing on-line
documents through a simple hypertext interface -- if you see a word or
picture underlined or highlighted, you can click on it to get more
information.  You may have already used the most common WWW browser:
Netscape.  If not, you will learn to use it very quickly!

Where to start
First, go to the CS110 lab, which is located in room 1350 of the
Computer Sciences and Statistics building (1210 W. Dayton Street).  If
you enter the building from Dayton Street, go straight ahead, all the
way past the two elevators to the water fountain.  Take a drink.  Turn
left, and the CS110 lab (``the Vectra lab'') is the first room on your
left.

Find a vacant seat.  The first step is to ``activate'' your CS110
account.  There are instructions for this posted on the walls, but it
really isn't too hard: simply type ``newuser'', followed by the
ENTER key, at the ``WILEY login:'' prompt.  When prompted for a password,
simply hit the ENTER key.  Now, follow the instructions, entering
information such as your student id number (be sure not
  to type in the dashes in your id number!).  Check the information,
and read the policies for your account.  Finally, you will be prompted
to choose a password.  You will need this password to login to the
system in the future, so PLEASE choose one that you can
remember!  It is not generally a good idea to write your password down
in case you forget it --- but if necessary, write it down in a safe
place.  You will probably want to write down your login name (e.g., my
login name is ``dsilva'') in any case.  When you next login, you will
use your assigned login name and your newly chosen password, not
``newuser''.

Once you have logged in, the computer will (annoyingly?) ask you if
you plan on using any floppy disks during this session.  Hit ``n'' to
indicate you aren't.  Now Microsoft Windows will start up; you will
see lots of little pictures, or ``icons'', all over the screen.  Each
icon represents a program you can run.

In this class, we will be primarily using the programs associated with
the following three icons: Borland C++ 4.5, Netscape (a big N), and
File Manager.

If you are totally clueless when it comes to Microsoft Windows,
 this would be an excellent time to go through the ``Windows tutorial''
 that exists on-line. You will have to view this using the Netscape
 browser program.  In order to accomplish this follow these steps:


 To run Netscape (as with any other applications program), double-click
on the Netscape icon in the Networking menu. 
   You will be looking at the CS Department Home Page.
A home page is basically a place on the World Wide Web which has links to 
other places or actual documents with information. 
   Click on Fall 1996 Classes. Any underlined words denote a link on the WWW. You will now be on the Course Listing Home Page.   
   Click on Sidney Hummert and that gets you to my home 
page. Now, choose "bookmarks" and then "add bookmarks" from the menu. This will
add my cs110 home page, to your "hotlist", so that it can easily be accessed
from any point in your "Internet Surfing" by going to the "bookmarks menu".
 


The hardest part is now over. You have all the course information 
at your fingertips. Look at my home page carefully. It  has my office hours,
syllabus and schedule, grading policy, late policy, class handout, tutorials
 on important software like Microsoft Windows.... It even has your
first program assignment.


Before you begin this assignment, it would be to your benifit to browse
through the  Introduction to Microsoft Windows  and Introduction to Borland C++turorials.
Netscape has another neat feature built into it--the back button. This is situated on the upper left corner of the Netscape window (just below the file menu).  Clicking on this button returns you to previous documents
you had been viewing.



Important to note is that Program 0 is due next Wednesday. So be sure
to take a look at it while still in Netscape. I recommend that you get started on the tutorials
and familiarize yourselves on the Borland C++ environment right away.
This is what the first week is all about --- the more time you spend
now, the more you will learn about the system, so that later on in the
semester you can concentrate entirely on the harder programming
assignments.

If you have any questions or problems, feel absolutely free to ask one
of the on-duty consultants for help.  These are people (probably sitting
at a computer) wearing yellow name badges.  There should always be 2 or 3
consultants in the lab.  Consultants are on duty Monday-Friday 8am-10pm,
Saturday 12pm-8pm, and Sunday 12pm-10pm

Good luck, and have a great semester!
