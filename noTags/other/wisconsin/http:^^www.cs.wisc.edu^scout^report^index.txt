Scout Report Homepage

































The Scout Report is a weekly publication of the InterNIC Net Scout project
at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. It is provided as a fast,
convenient way to stay informed of valuable resources on the Internet. Its
purpose is to combine in one place new and newly discovered Internet
resources and network tools, especially those of interest to our primary
audience, researchers and educators. The service is designed for
Internauts who want their Internet announcements selectively filtered and
summarized once each week.

Care is taken in the selection of items included in the Scout Report.
Basic criteria include depth of content, author, information maintenance,
and presentation. The content of each resource is briefly described.

The Scout Report is made available via several access methods, including
two mailing lists -- one for a plain-text version of the Report, and a
separate mailing list for an HTML version. The Web site holds this weeks
report in addition to an archive of all past reports, which are
searchable.

Organizations are encouraged to link to this page from their own Web
pages, or to receive the HTML version of the Report each week via email
for local posting at their site.
