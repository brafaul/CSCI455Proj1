Quiz 4 (Take Home)
Due Monday, November 11, 1996


This quiz is a ``take home'' assignment that counts the same as an
in-class quiz.  Like an in-class quiz, this should be all of your own
work, though you are welcome to use your text and/or a computer to
assist you in this assignment.  Your answers may be written out by
hand, or preferably, typed.


 (5 points) Write a function called display that takes
two parameters: an array of characters and an integer for size of the
array.  The function should write the first N characters of the array
to cout, where N is the size parameter that was passed into
the function.  (Precondition: The size passed in will not be longer
than the actual size of the array.) 
 (5 points) Write a function called num_equal that
takes three parameters: two arrays of integers and an integer variable
for the number of valid entries in the array (in most cases just the
size of the array).  The function should return the number of pairs of
integers that are the same.  For example, if the function was passed
two arrays {1, 2, 3, 4} and {2, 2, 3, 5}, and size 4, the function
would return 2.  (Precondition: The size passed in will not be longer
than the actual size of either array.) 
 (8 points) Design and implement a QuizScores class.  This
class will be used to read in and average quiz scores.  All quiz
scores are integers from the range 0-20.  You will need the following
private variables:
    
 an array of integers to hold the scores.  Declare this to
contain at least 100 elements.
       an integer to keep track of how many quiz scores you read
in.
    
You will need the following public methods:
    
 a constructor which takes a single ifstream as a
parameter and reads the data from that file.  The first integer in the
data file is the number of quiz scores.  The rest of the file contains
N integer quiz scores, where N is the first integer in the file.  The
data should be read from the file and stored in the private array
variable, and also set the integer that keeps track of the number of
scores entered.  If the number of scores in the file is greater than
the size of the array to hold the scores, give an error message and
exit(1) the program.
    an average method which takes no parameters and
returns the average quiz score, a double.
    a getNumber method which returns the number of quiz
scores read in.
     
 (2 points) Modify your QuizScores class by adding another
public method that will produce a histogram of the results.  The
method should take a single ofstream as a parameter and write
to that stream a histogram of the quiz results.  To do this you will
need a local array variable with 21 elements (0-20 is 21 possible
scores).  Use this array to count how many time each score occurs in
the file.  For example, if the quiz scores were 10, 15, 15, 15, 15, 18, 18, 20, the following should be displayed:

 0: 
 1:
 2:
 3:
 4:
 5:
 6:
 7:
 8:
 9:
10:*
11:
12:
13:
14:
15:****
16:
17:
18:**
19:
20:*


(Note: This question is only two points due to the extra time it will
take to complete, if you can not finish this or can't figure it out,
the most you can lose on this problem is only two points.)
