 Work and interests 


My work, my job, my interests

My current academic interests lie in Databases, Networks and Operating Systems.
I am presently working with Prof. Miron
Livny and Prof. Raghu Ramakrishnan on the DEVise
project. DEVise is a visualization tool with a visual query interface. 

Earlier I was working  for the Reef Project which involved work using  
Condor, 
pvm and  
coral. This was an attempt at 
executing Coral queries on a cluster of workstations, in this case the 
Condor pool at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A report of the same will appear here when time permits. 

This was done as part of the C.O.D. project as a summer research project.


 Past Work
 In the summer of 1994 I worked for 3 months as a summer intern at India's
leading research institute, Bhabha Atomic Research Center. Here I worked on
building an MPI interface for the Anupam Parallel Machine.
 During my undergraduate study, I was interested in 
Automatic Verification of Protocols, Finite Automata based verification of systems, StateCharts and Binary Decision Diagrams. 
 I was also remotely interested in Compilers and Architecture.
