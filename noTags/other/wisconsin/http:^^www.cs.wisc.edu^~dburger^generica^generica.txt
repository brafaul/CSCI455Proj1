generica, your dependable source for New York's best alternative pop, is the
latest adventure of 26-year-old South Carolina native Asa Somers (vocals, 
acoustic guitar). Armed with memorable hook-filled melodies, lyrics of 
uncommon intelligence that tell compelling stories, and tight musicianship, 
generica has swept through the downtown New York club scene, captivating a 
growing following with its collection of guitar-based, vocally 
driven songs. 
	Critics have called generica's sound everything from "tasty" and 
"post-punk" to "poignant" and "starry-eyed." Whatever. The band prefers to 
think of its unique blend of funky, infectious grooves and carefully crafted
lyrics as post-power pop. As a singer, Somers has been described as "a Jeff 
Buckley for the rest of us," and while his hyperkinetic stage antics lead to
a troubling number of broken strings, he remains unfazed: "Hey, it's cheaper
than smashing the whole guitar." 
	After a year-long stretch of performances at clubs including The Mercury 
Lounge, Cafe Sin-e, AKA, New Music Cafe, and CBGB Gallery, Somers took the 
band into the studio in July, 1994 to record its debut CD, Glass Eye. 
generica's current lineup came together in July of this year, when Somers 
was joined by bassist Thomas Fiorini, drummer Pete Pepe, and electric 
guitarist Mark Kondracki. 
	Since then, Somers and generica have been touring south of 14th St., 
playing material from Glass Eye as well as many new songs, 
including the consistently crowd-pleasing "Superstar," "Stranger Things Have
Happened," "I Will Follow You," "Deceived," and "Today's the Day."
