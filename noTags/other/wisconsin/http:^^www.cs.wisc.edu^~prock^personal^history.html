Personal History

I grew up in the cold city of
Minneapolis. A very
nice place to live but to be honest, I don't really recomend visiting
there. I went to Minneapolis South
High School and spent much of my time there on the math, and swim
teams. If you are really really really curious about Minneapolis check out
this site.

I went to southern California for my undergraduate. I received my BA in
Mathematics from USD in San Diego. It is a
small, Catholic, liberal arts university that specializes in Business. It also
has one of the pretiest campuses in Southern California.

After my four year adventure in San Diego I returned to Mineapolis. I
basically relaxed for a while and met a lot of interesting people. In
particular I met Rachel, my girlfriend and an interesting computer
artist named Forrest. He
is the one responsible for the backgrounds 
on my homepage. 
Check out his art
gallery. I also spent a couple of months employed at NSC, a Minneapolis based router 
company like Cisco.

I am currently a Computer Sciences grad student at the  UW Madison. It is a lot colder here than
in San Diego, but just a bit warmer than Minneapolis. Of course as a
graduate student the department expects me to take classes.

To make ends meet (which they barely do) I work as a TA for CS 302. I am also a 
math tutor. If interested mail me.
