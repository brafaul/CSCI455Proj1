 Printing Output from Outside the Lab 


 Printing Output from Outside the Lab 

I've had several people ask me about printing the output for their program
on a compiler that doesn't support the handy "Print" option in the
Output Window.  If you're trying to do the homeworks from someplace other
than the lab, and you can't get the output to go the printer, here's my
advice:

 Printing from a Unix System 

If you're on a Unix system (probably using g++ or CC), use the "script"
command if you have it.  It copies all input and output of the program
to a file called "typescript" ... then you can simply print the file.
Here is an example:



/usr/home/jdoe# g++ -o prog1 prog1.cpp
/usr/home/jdoe# script
Script started, file is typescript
/usr/home/jdoe# prog1
Welcome to John Doe's program ...
 ... etc ...
/usr/home/jdoe# exit
Script done, file is typescript
/usr/home/jdoe# lpr -Pmylaser typescript



Warning: If you use the script command, don't forget to type exit when you
are done!  And don't "nest" script commands.

 Printing from a DOS (non-Windows) System 

If you're on a DOS system (not running Windows), you can redirect the output
of your program to a file.  For example, if you've compiled your program
into an executable called PROG1.EXE, you can redirect the output to
a file "output.txt" using the following DOS command:


   prog1 >output.txt


Also, you can "append" the output of your program to a previous run with
two greater-than signs:


   prog1 >>output.txt



This has two disadvantages, however.  First, since the output is going to
a file, you can't see it on the screen!  So you have to "know" what the
expected input is beforehand.  Second, the input you type is not redirected
to the file.  Thus you need to modify your program to "echo" the input
so that it appears in the file too.  For example:



#include <iostream.h>

int main ()
{
   int num_apples;
   cout << "How many apples do you want?";
   cin >> num_apples;
   cout << num_apples << endl; // ECHO INPUT FOR REDIRECTION
   return 0;
}

 Printing on Any System 

If you're printing from any other system that doesn't have a "Print Output"
command or doesn't support redirection, you can use the following techinque.
This should work on any system: Windows, Mac, Unix, etc.



The idea is to modify the program so that all the output goes to a file
instead of a screen.  Thus this method suffers the same problems as the
DOS method above: output is not displayed on the screen (i.e. you can't
see the prompts) and input is not redirected to the file (thus you have
to echo the input in your program).  For example, consider the following
program:



#include <iostream.h>

int main ()
{
   int num_apples;
   cout << "How many apples do you want?";
   cin >> num_apples;
   return 0;
}



To make this program's input and output go to a file named "output.txt",
we could modify it like this (note the extra #include directive):


#include <iostream.h>
#include <fstream.h>

int main ()
{
   ofstream fout = "output.txt";  // Open a file for writing
   cout = fout;                   // Redirect cout to the file

   int num_apples;
   cout << "How many apples do you want?";
   cin >> num_apples;
   cout << num_apples << endl;    // Echo input for redirection
   return 0;
}



Once you have the program's output saved in a file, you can use almost
any means to print that file out.  Under Windows you can use the Notepad,
for example.

 If All Else Fails 

If, for some reason, all of the above methods fail for you (the last one
_should_ work), you will have to print the output from the Vectra lab.
Put the source code on a floppy disk, go to the lab, compile the program,
and print the output.
