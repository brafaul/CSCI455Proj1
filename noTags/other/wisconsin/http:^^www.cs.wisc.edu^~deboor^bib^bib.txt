 SEARCH  
here for all the references fitting a given pattern, but be aware that the
search is run on a very slow machine, hence takes about one minute.

 email corrections and additions to:    deboor@cs.wisc.edu
or  enter them via an

electronic form 


The references are sorted alphabetically by author, with each reference
carrying a unique label, fashioned from author name(s) and year of publication.

The references are in a format that makes it (i) easy to convert them via \TeX,
into whatever format some journal or editor might desire, yet make it (ii) easy
to type them in without the need for various code words.
The \TeX\ file 

 refmac.tex
contains details
and examples for the use of these references in a \TeX\ environment.
The format is explained in detail at the end of the \TeX-file

 journal.tex
which also contains the definition of the 
abbreviations of journal names used in the references. The abbreviations
for standard proceedings used can be found in

 proceed.tex.
