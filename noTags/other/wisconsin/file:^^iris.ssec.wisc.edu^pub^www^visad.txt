Introduction

VisAD is a system for visualizing and interactively steering scientifc
computations.  It provides:

* An interactive computational environment combining a flexible
interpreted language with linkages to Fortran and C.

* A data model that lets users design data types appropriate
to their applications.

* A novel and flexible way to visualize computations.

VisAD includes a large number of example programs and data sets
that demonstrate its flexibility.  While it has been developed
primarily to meet the needs of environmental scientists, its
flexibility makes it useful to any scientists who develop
algorithms or use computers to analyze data.

Here's a screen shot of VisAD:



Version 1.1 of VisAD runs on Silicon Graphics workstation.
Later versions will be ported to other vendors' workstations.

VisAD was written by the
 Visualization Project
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
 Space Science and Engineering Center
(SSEC) by
 Bill Hibbard  and
 Brian Paul . 

The development of VisAD was supported by NASA.
How to get VisAD

VisAD is available by anonymous ftp.  The
 README 
file contains the complete VisAD documentation.
The latest version of VisAD is in

If you are in Europe


Recently users in Europe have had problems with low bandwidth to North American
ftp servers.  The
Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum
has offered to serve as a mirror
site for our software.  Here are the pointers to the
VisAD README
file and to the
visad.1.1.tar.Z
file.

Manual ftp operation:
