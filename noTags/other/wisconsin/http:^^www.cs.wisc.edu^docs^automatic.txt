Automaticly indexed documents


Automatically Indexed Documents

The Web server runs a script three times a day to check for HTML files with
special names in people's home directories.  If these files exist, they are
linked into master lists for easy accessibility.  The auto-indexed pages
currently include:


 ``Home'' or ``signature'' pages
 Classes pages

``Home'' or ``signature'' pages

Directories of Computer Sciences
Faculty and Research Staff,
Graduate Students, and
Undergraduate Majors are 
automatically generated. Links to home pages are included for
every file with the name 
~username/public/html/username.html in the 
AFS filesystem.  (This isn't true
yet.  Currently only those accounts that fit into the above lists are
indexed.  We will be adding a catch-all ``other'' list soon.)

Remember that our server translates ~username to 
~username/public/html, so the URL for user Joe's homepage, 
for example, would be http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~joe/joe.html, even 
though it is stored in the filesystem at ~joe/public/html/joe.html.

Class pages

Pages for classes are looked for 
in two places.  The first is any file
matching the pattern ~cs(course_number)-(section)/public/html/cs(course_number).html.  The second is any with the same name,
but in the course instructor's account instead of the course account.  The
second form is the only one available to cs302 instructors.
