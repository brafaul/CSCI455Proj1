SACM Coke Club



SACM Coke Club
 In order to generate revenue for the Wisconsin SACM chapter, and
to circumvent the ridiculous 60-cent campus monopoly on 12 oz
cans of soda pop -- and just be geeky to boot -- our coke machine
has been computerized.  It does not accept coin or currency, but instead
debits a person's coke account whenever they login to the terminal
alongside the coke machine and buy a coke.


So how does it work?

 Deposits to a coke account can be made in any amount; just get it
to the SACM mailbox on the 5th floor (include username and "coke" written
somewhere) or to one of the Coke Heads listed below.

   Withdrawals cause 40 cent decrements to a user's coke account
balance until the account is reduced to below 40 cents.  The coke
machine does not give credit!
 Funds can be transferred to another user.

   The coke machine will automatically email you when you make a
deposit, transfer money, or are running low on funds.


Additional information can be gleaned from the following formatted man page.

Machine specs (finger it): 

 Digital(tm) Celebris XL 590
   Chip: 90 Mhz Pentium
   RAM: 64 MB
   OS: Solaris 5.5

The SACM coke machine is under the direct supervision of the SACM Coke
Heads: 



 Martin Reames (Coke Poobah)
   Elton Glaser (co-Coke Poobah)


If you have any problems with the coke machine, please contact one of us.
Note that even if you ask very nicely, we're not going to put anything but
Coke products into our machine, because that would be wrong.  Coke is
it!
Of course, none of this would be possible without The Real Thing.


 Ours is merely one of many coke machines on the internet; many exist
all around the world, and some are far more elaborate than ours.   Here is a link to
the canonical source for internet coke machines.
