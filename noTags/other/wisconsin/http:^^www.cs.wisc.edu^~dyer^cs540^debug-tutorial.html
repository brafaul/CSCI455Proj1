 How to debug in GCL 



 How to debug in GCL 

There are several debugging facilities in GCL Common Lisp:


 loading syntax checking;
  step function;
  interactive break package;
  trace function;


In this tutorial a simple piece of buggy lisp code is used 
to show you how to use these debugging facilities.

Assume we have a file named "buggy.lisp" with the following
function definitions.

;;; File buggy.lisp begins
;;; separate takes a list containing, at any level,
;;; symbols and numbers, and returns a list of the form:
;;; (all-numbers-in-the-list, all-symbols-in-the-list).

(defun separate (alist)
  (cond ((endp alist) nil)
        ((endp (first alist)) (separate (rest alist)))
        ((numberp (first alist))
             (cons (first alist) (separate (rest alist))))
        ((symbol (first alist))
             (append (separate (rest alist)) (list (first alist))))
        (t
             (merge (separate (first alist)) (separate (rest alist))))

(defun merge (list1 list2)
   (let (result list2)
      (dolist (anitom list1 result)
          (cond ((numberp anitom)
                     (setq result (cons anitom result))))
                ((symbolp anitom)
                     (setq result (append result (list anitom)))))))

;;; File buggy.lisp ends.

1) We try to load the code by (load "buggy.lisp") and we get:


   Error: Unexpected end of #.
   Fast links are on: do (use-fast-links nil) for debugging
   Error signaled by LOAD.
   Broken at LOAD.  Type :H for Help.


This means that we have more ('s than )'s in the file. Here LOAD
can detect the extra ('s,  but just ignores extra )'s, which may
cause problems later in execution. 


To fix that, 

 insert one "print" statement after each "defun" block to
find out which "defun" block has the extra ('s. 
 use "vi"'s commands
"(" ")" and "{" "}" in that "defun" block to match up ('s and )'s. 


By doing that we find that I need 2 more )'s at the end of SEPARATE 
function. The corrected SEPARATE function is as below:

(defun separate (alist)
  (cond ((endp alist) nil)
        ((numberp (first alist)) 
            (cons (first alist) (separate (rest alist))))
        ((symbolp (first alist))
            (append (separate (rest alist)) (list (first alist))))
        (t 
            (merge (separate (first alist)) (separate (rest alist))))))
                                            ;;; *****> ERROR1 corrected
                                                                  
Run (load "buggy.lisp") again and get the following message:

   Loading buggy.lisp
   Warning: MERGE is being redefined.
   Finished loading buggy.lisp
   T


The warning means GCL already have a function named "merge", but your
definition will have a higher priority to be used.


2) Now run (separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) and get:


   Error: The function SYMBOL is undefined.
   Fast links are on: do (use-fast-links nil) for debugging
   Error signaled by COND.
   Broken at COND.  Type :H for Help.
   >>


The break package is invoked automatically. Now if we enter break 
command :h, we will get a list of all break commands. 


For example :m prints last break message: 


    The function SYMBOL is undefined. 


So we know that the error is related to SYMBOL.


:b prints full backtrace of all functions:


    Backtrace: system:top-level > eval > separate > COND


So now we know where and when the error occurs.

So we look for SYMBOL in the COND statement inside SEPARATE function
and find that we should use SYMBOLP instead of SYMBOL to do the type
checking. 


(defun separate (alist)
  (cond ((endp alist) nil)
        ((numberp (first alist))
             (cons (first alist) (separate (rest alist))))
        ((symbolp (first alist))
        ;;; ******> ERROR2 corrected
             (append (separate (rest alist)) (list (first alist))))
        (t
             (merge (separate (first alist)) (separate (rest alist))))))


3) We run (separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) again and get:


   Error: (SYMBOLP ANITOM) is invalid as a function.
   Fast links are on: do (use-fast-links nil) for debugging
   Error signaled by DOLIST.
   Broken at DOLIST.  Type :H for Help.
   >>


Use :m and :b break commands again:


    >>:m
    (SYMBOLP ANITOM) is invalid as a function.


The problem is that GCL tries to interpret the result returned 
from (symbolp anitom) as a function.


    >>:b
    Backtrace: system:top-level > eval > separate > cond > append >
    separate > cond > merge > separate > cond > merge > let > DOLIST


The problem happens after several recursive calls of SEPARATE and 
in the DOLIST statement in the MERGE function.


Originally, we intend that (SYMBOLP ANITOM) is a case of the COND 
statement, but now it seems that COND finishes correctly and 
the program returns from COND and breaks in the DOLIST. So it 
implies that COND is ended too early by some extra )'s and
(SYMBOLP ANITOM) is left out of COND and treated by GCL as 
a function. 


We check all )'s in the COND statement and find there is a extra )
for the case before (SYMBOLP ANITOM). We fix that by deleting that )
and adding another ) at the end of (SYMBOLP ANITOM) case to include 
it in the COND statement.


(defun merge (list1 list2)
   (let (result list2)
      (dolist (anitom list1 result)
          (cond ((numberp anitom)
                    (setq result (cons anitom result)))
                                      ;;; ******> ERROR3 corrected
                ((symbolp anitom)
                    (setq result (append result (list anitom))))))))
                                      ;;; ******> ERROR3 corrected


4) Now we run  (separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) and get:


    (1 A)


Although we do not get break error message, this result is not as we expect. 
Now we can use TRACE to trace MERGE and SEPARATE to see if they are working
correctly.


    >(trace merge)
    Warning: MERGE is being redefined.
    (MERGE)


BTW, You can always turn off the trace on "merge" by (untrace merge) command.


>(separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2)))
(separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2)))
1> (MERGE (1) (B))      ====> call with (1) and (B)
  <1 (MERGE (1))        ====> should return (1 B) not just (1).
  1> (MERGE (2 NIL) NIL)
  <1 (MERGE (2 NIL))
  1> (MERGE (1) (2 NIL))
  <1 (MERGE (1))
(1 A)


So we find that merge is not working as expected. For example:
(merge (1) (B)) should return (1 B) instead of (1). So we decide
to turn off the trace and use STEP to look through a simple case
more closely.


>(untrace merge)
>(step (merge '(1) '(b)))
Type ? and a newline for help.
  (MERGE '(1) ...) 
    '(1) 
    '(B) 
    (LET (RESULT LIST2) ...) 
      NIL       <====== ERROR4
      NIL       
      (DOLIST (ANITOM LIST1 ...) ...) 
        LIST1 
        = (1)
        (COND (# #) ...) 
          (NUMBERP ANITOM) 
            ANITOM 
            = 1
          = T
          (SETQ RESULT ...) 
            (CONS ANITOM ...) 
              ANITOM 
              = 1
              RESULT 
              = NIL
            = (1)
          = (1)
        = (1)
        RESULT     
        = (1)
      = (1)
    = (1)
  = (1)
(1)


Through the steps, we find that the problem is that we tried to 
initialize RESULT by LIST2. But it turns out they are both NIL. 
How could this happen? We look up LET statement and find that
(LET ((RESULT LIST2)) ...) will initialize RESULT with LIST2 while
(LET (RESULT LIST2) will treat RESULT and LIST2 as new local variables
and initialize them to NIL.


We fix that and run (merge '(1) '(B)) and (separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2))) 
again.


This time they are almost working the way we want:


    >(merge '(1) '(B))
    (1 B)
    >(separate '(a ((1) b) (() 2)))
    (1 2 NIL B A)


But not yet, the () or nil should not be accumulated. So you have to exclude 
this specific case from your result by adding one more case in the COND statement
in the SEPARATE function.


(defun separate (alist)
  (cond ((endp alist) nil)
        ((null (first alist)) (separate (rest alist)))
        ;;; *****> ERROR5 corrected
        ((numberp (first alist))
             (cons (first alist) (separate (rest alist))))
        ((symbolp (first alist))
             (append (separate (rest alist)) (list (first alist))))
        (t
             (merge (separate (first alist)) (separate (rest alist))))))


Now you will be ready to turn in and relax.
