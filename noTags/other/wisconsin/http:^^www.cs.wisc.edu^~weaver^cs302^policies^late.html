CS302 Late Policy







CS302 Late Policy
    Sections 16 and 17





Submitting Assignments

Programming assignments consist of printed copies of both source
code and the output generated by the program, and by copying
your files to a special "hand-in" directory
(R:\handin\weaver\your_login). Specific instructions are
provided in the assignment pages. It is your responsiblility to plan ahead
and get your work done early. The following late policy is provided in case
of emergencies, and is not to be used carelessly.

Programming assignments are due at the beginning of class on the
assigned due date. Programs received after the beginning of class will be
considered late.

Grace Periods

You have five "grace periods" that you may use throughout the
	semester. You may use grace periods to turn in an assignment late
	without a late penalty. You may use up to 3 grace periods on an
	assignment.

    Each week has three late periods. The period from the beginning of
	a Monday/Wednesday/Friday class to the beginning of the following
	Wednesday/Friday/Monday class is one late period.

No program will be accepted after a week late, or after the last
	day of classes.
    Once you have used up your grace days, late assignments are
	deducted 30% for each late period.
