 IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Robot Motion 
and Path Planning 



   IEEE RAS Tech. Committee  
on Robot Motion & Path Planning      
  Groups active in motion planning 
research   
 This is a partial list of people and organizations involved in
research on automatic motion planning. At this time, one name for
contact (noted by "c:") is given for each organization. The areas covered include
both theory and applications of motion planning methodology:
robotics, computational geometry, control systems, CAD-CAM design
etc.  Those interested in adding, deleting, or correcting
information on this list, please send your messages to
        lumelsky@engr.wisc.edu.   
  In the future, we may want to provide more than just names and
addresses, so please add few words about your group: the name of the
group; your position; nature of work; any software that your group
can post so that people can try it; if available, a Web link to a
page with more information. 

We expect this list to grow, both in volume and diversity of
information it provides. For example, one section to add is a
bulletin of events that are of interest to this group; those
interested in posting such information please send it to us. Advices
on how we can make this page more effective are most welcome.
