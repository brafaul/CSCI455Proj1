CS 537 - Fix for Project 2



Fix for Project 2

As I mentioned in class, the

suggested algorithm

for Project 2 algorithm 2
has a very small change of deadlocking if preemptive scheduling is
in effect.
A couple of teams have actually experienced this problem, showing that
Murphy's law is valid:  If something can go wrong, it eventually will.
Deadlocks due to the bug have been reported under the Windows Java
implementation, which has built-in preemptive scheduling.  I do no know if
anybody has observed them under Solaris, even with the ThreadScheduler.

Disclaimers:


This problem applies only to the second (``hygienic'') algorithm.
If your algorithm 1 deadlocks, you have some other bug in your program.

You are not required to fix this bug to get full credit for the
assignment.  I'm only telling your about it in case you're
having problems tracking down the cause of a deadlock and
suspect it might be due to this problem.

It is very likely that the deadlock you're seeing is not
due to this problem, but to some more ``ordinary'' bug in your program.
If your program deadlocks under Solaris without the ThreadScheduler
it is certainly because of some other bug.
(To turn off the ThreadScheduler, simply comment out the line
sched.start().)
If it deadlocks only under Windows, it is more likely (but not certain)
that the bug is caused by this problem.

The problem arises because synchronized methods contain calls to other
synchronized methods and it is possible to set up a circular
pattern of calls between distinct objects.
For example, if A and B are neighboring Philosopher objects,
A.takeForks() calls B.requestFork(), and B.putForks() calls A.giveFork().
Suppose thread t1 is preempted while active (not waiting) in A.takeForks(),
and thread t2 is allowed to enter B.putForks().  At this point,
t1 is locking A and t2 is locking B.  When t2 calls A.giveFork() it
will block waiting for A's mutex, and when t1 is subsequently resumed
and calls B.requestFork() it will block on B's mutex.  At that point
t1 and t2 are deadlocked.

In today's class (Oct 9), Joni Baker pointed out that this particular
scenario cannot occur if the code is carefully written to prevent
duplicate requests, as in the sample code I wrote on the blackboard.
B.putForks() only calls A.giveFork() if B has previously requested
the fork from B, but
A.takeForks() only calls B.requestFork() if A has not previously
requested it.
In class, I said that a more complicated scenario could be devised to
show that deadlock is still possible, but couldn't think of one on the spot.
It seems to require at least three philosophers.

Consider a circular pattern of philosophers, A, B, and C, each pair sharing
one fork (i.e., a three-philosopher version of the original dining philosophers 
problem).
Assume B is eating, so he has the forks he shares with A and C,
and A has the fork she shares with C.
Let tA, tB, and tC represents the threads for philosophers A, B, and C.
Suppose C gets hungry just before B finishes eating, and A gets hungry just
after.
The following sequence of events is possible.

C gets hungry, so thread tA enters C.takeForks() and calls B.requestFork(),
which returns false because B is eating.
Thread tC is preempted.
B finishes eating, so tB enters putForks(), and seeing that there is a
request from C, tries to call C.giveFork().
Thread tB is blocked because tC is still active in C.takeForks().
A gets hungry, so tA enters A.getForks().  She already has the fork
she shares with C, so tA tries to call B.requestFork(), but
is blocked because tB is still active in B.putForks().
Thread tC is resumed and tries to call A.getFork().

At that point the three threads are deadlocked.

Here is the example I couldn't show this morning because there was
no projector.  This is the original version of takeForks() from
the TA's solution to the project.

private synchronized void takeForks() {
    state = HUNGRY;
    int forksHave = 0; // Number of forks currently owned

    while (forksHave < forks.length) {
        for (int i = 0; i < forks.length; i++) {
            if (forks[i].have)
                forksHave++;
            else if (!forks[i].haveRequested) {
                if (phil[forks[i].neighborId].requestFork(forks[i].forkId)){
                    forks[i].clean = true;
                    forks[i].have = true;
                    forksHave++;
                }
                else
                    forks[i].haveRequested = true;
                }
            }
        }
        if (forksHave < forks.length) {
            forksHave = 0;
            try { wait(); }
            catch (InterruptedException e)  {}
        }
    }
    state = EATING;
}

The trick is to split takeForks into two pieces.
The first, called forksNeeded(), is a synchronized procedure that
does all the necessary manipulation of shared variables.  The remaining
code does not touch any shared variables that ever change,
so it does not have to be synchronized.

/* This procedure finds a fork that this philosopher doesn't have and needs
to request and returns its index.
If no such fork exists because all forks are here it returns -1 and sets
the local state to EATING.
If no such fork exists because all absent forks have already been requested,
it waits and tries again. */
private synchronized int neededFork() {
    state = HUNGRY;

    for (;;) {
        int forksHave = 0; // Number of forks currently owned
        for (int i = 0; i < forks.length; i++) {
            if (forks[i].have)
                forksHave++;
            else if (!forks[i].haveRequested) {
                forks[i].haveRequested = true;
                return i;
            }
        }
        if (forksHave == forks.length) {
            state = EATING;
            return -1;
        }
        try { wait(); }
        catch (InterruptedException e)  {}
    }
}

private void takeForks() {
    for (;;) {
        int i = neededFork();
        if (i == -1)
            return;
        if (phil[forks[i].neighborId].requestFork(forks[i].forkId))
            giveFork(forks[i].forkId); // give myself the fork
    }
}

At the end of class, Patrick Gaffney pointed out that there's still
a danger of a race condition.
What happens if thread tA is preempted in A.takeForks() after its call
to B.requestFork() has returned true but before it gets a chance to call
A.giveFork()?  At this point neither A nor B thinks it has the fork.
The call B.requestFork() has updated B's data structure to indicate that B
does not have it, but A.giveFork() has not had a chance to update A's variables
to show that A has it.
This is not necessarily a problem, but the code has to be carefully written
so that it can cope with this unusual situation.
For example, if tB is allowed to run next, it may become hungry, and seeing
that it no longer has the fork, it may call A.requestFork(), which will
find that A doesn't have the fork that is being requested.
At this point, neither philosopher thinks he has the fork.
