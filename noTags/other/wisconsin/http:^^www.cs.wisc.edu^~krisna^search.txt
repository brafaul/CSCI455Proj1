Search



Search (using Glimpse)

You can search the contents of all of my personal Web pages
rooted at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~krisna/ using
Agrep-style regular expressions.

You can provide search predicates using the entry form provided below.
The result of the search is a single page containing pointers to all
pages which match the search predicates provided.  Be sure to escape
any metacharacters in your search predicates as appropriate.

Search Form


Search predicate: 
: Case-insensitive matches.
: Show matching lines.




Miscellaneous Information

This section is for those who are interested in the details of the
search procedure.

The agrep-style searching is done an a pre-built index (which
is updated periodically).  Indices are built and searched using the
Glimpse toolkit.
By default, matches are case-sensitive and the lines that match the
search predicate are not shown in the output.

Enabling the output of matching lines produces a cluttered display,
but may sometimes help in narrowing down the search if too many pages
match the predicate.  An attempt is made to highlight the predicate in
the matched lines but this is not guaranteed to be always successful
(for reasons too mundane to go into).
Problems?

Remember to escape meta-characters.  This is very important.  The search
script feeds your predicate to glimpse as is.  Any errors from
glimpse are quietly ignored.

The search-indices are currently built on deHTMLized pages.  This means
that a search predicate will not match HTML keywords unless the actual
contents of the page would also produce such a match.  However, if you
enable match output, HTML tags will also be displayed (this is done in
order to make the searching as fast as possible).

Comments are welcome.
