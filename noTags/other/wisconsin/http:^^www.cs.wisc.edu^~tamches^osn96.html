Waiting list:
We had more people sign up than there are available slots. So,
some people signed up for a waiting list (you know who you are).
They'll get first dibs for next semester's seminar:



 Choosing a Talk 
The first choice is to give a talk on research which you are doing.
Alternatively, you can give a talk on just about anything related to
operating systems.  I've put together a list of recent conference papers
which should make for interesting talks.  (Of course, you don't need to limit
your choices to this list; they're just suggestions.)
The papers are mostly from SOSP 15
(Fifteenth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles; December, 1995),
OSDI-I (First USENIX Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation; November, 1994),

HotOS-V (Fifth Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems; May, 1995), 
ASPLOS-VII
(Seventh ACM Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems), and
OSDI-II.

Mobile Computing:
Exploiting
Weak Connectivity for Mobile File Access by Lily Mummert, Maria Ebling, and M.
Satyanarayanan (CMU).  Appears in SOSP-15.
Rover: A Toolkit for Mobile Information Access by Anthony Joseph, Alan deLespinasse, Joshua Tauber, David Gifford, and M. Frans Kaashoek (MIT).  Appears in SOSP-15.

Kernels:
On Micro-Kernel Construction
by Jochen Liedtke (GMD).  Appears in SOSP-15.

Extensibility, Safety and Performance in the SPIN Operating System
by Brian Bershad et al. (Washington).  Appears in SOSP-15.

Networks of Workstations:
Implementing Global Memory Management in a Workstation Cluster by Michael Feeley, William Morgan, Frederic Pighin, Anna Karlin, Henry Levy, and Chandramohan Thekkath (DEC SRC and U-Washington).  Appears in SOSP-15.
Distributed Filaments: Efficient Fine-Grain Parallelism on a Cluster of Workstations by Vincent Freeh, David Lowenthal, and Gregory Andrews (Arizona).  Appears in OSDI-I.

Threads:
Thread Scheduling for Cache Locality by James Philbin, Jan Edler: NEC Research Institute, Otto J. Anshus: University of Tromso, Craig C. Douglas: IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and Kai Li: Princeton University.



Distributed File Systems:
