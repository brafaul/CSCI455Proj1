Getting places faster
If you've just started using Mosaic, you're probably travelling around the pages
available on the Web by clicking on links other people have provided. So to
get to your instructor's page, for example, you may have been going through
4 other pages first.

You don't have to do this. You can make your own links. Then going to a
desired page requires only one step.
Making a hotlist
The easiest way to make your own links is to use a hotlist. When you
are on a page to which you want a one-step link, you can select from the
Navigate menu the item Add Current To Hotlist. This will
add the page to a hierarchical menu accessible from the Starting Points
menu item Home Pages. Whenever you want to return to this page, you
can just select it from this Home Pages hierarchical menu.

Changing the first page you see
In your U:\ directory is a file called MOSAIC.INI. Make a backup copy of the
file, in case something goes wrong. Then double-click on the file from the
File Manager. The file is opened in an editor. One line of the file reads
"Home Page=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/". You can change this 
to another page.

For example, to make the first page be the CS302 home page, first go to that
page in Mosaic. In the Mosaic window above the page is a line of text identified
as Document URL. The URL should be 
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/cs302.html. You can change the home page
line in MOSAIC.INI to read "Home Page=http//www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/cs302.html".
