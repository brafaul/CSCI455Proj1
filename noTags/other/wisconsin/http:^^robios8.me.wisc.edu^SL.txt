What is SL 2.0 ? 

The simulation library (SL) is a collection of C-language
functions that provide a framework in which to develop computer
simulations of 2D robotic systems. SL helps a programmer concentrate
solely on implementation issues specific to his/her simulation, such as
a particular motion planning algorithm or a new type of kinematic
structure. The idea is to (1) simplify and standardize the low-level
aspects of most simulation programs (e.g., graphics, user-interface
construction, run time interactivity), and (2) factor out the
repetitive steps specific to writing simulations in robotics.
For example, many simulations involve constructing and drawing
a robot in its environment. SL addresses that by providing a
high-level C-language interface in which to define, draw, and animate
a robot, its environment, and the interaction between these two.  

The library supports:


 User-interface construction and run-time interaction
 Drawing and manipulation of geometric primitives
 Color and animation
 2D modeling transformations
 Obstacle database management
 Sensor-based motion-planning algorithms
 Modeling and manipulation of 2D robots


Downloading and installing SL

The library can be obtained via anonymous ftp from robios8.me.wisc.edu
in directory /pub/SL. Both
IRIX 5 and
SunOS 4.1.4
versions are available. 

A compressed postsciprt version of the user's manual for the library
is also avaliable via anonymous ftp from robios8.me.wisc.edu in the
directory 
/pub/TechReports as TR.RL-95002.ps.gz.
