Common C++ Programming Errors


Common C++ Programming Errors
This page list common C++ coding errors, some of which are legal C++ code
but have an unexpected behavior.  If you have suggestions for this list, please
send email to skrentny@cs.wisc.edu.
These common errors are ordered into the following categories:


C++ Basics
Control Structures
Basic Data Structures
Functions


C++ Basics

case isn't CASE isn't CaSe
C++ is case sensitive!  Different capitalizations can be used to
     make different identifiers.  The convention that I follow uses ALLCAPS
     for constants, Initial_Cap for type names, and lower_case for variable
     names.
     
     typedef float Case;
     const Case CASE = 22.0;
     Case case = CASE;
     
dividing division
Any time both operands of the / (division op) are
     integral types (i.e. integers) the operation becomes whole number
     division rather than fractional division.  You must change one of the
     operands by using type casting to a real number (e.g. float, double)
     to get fractional division.  The code below displays
      5,5,5.5 

     int i = 11, j = 2;
     float k = i/j;
     cout << ( i/j ) << ',' << k << ',' << ( i/float(j) ) << endl;
     
something is true and nothing is false
Any nonzero value means logical true, whereas only 0 is false.  Our
     g++ compiler provides the bool type and the values
     true and false for booleans.
     Since this is now supported, it is preferred to use this type rather than
     an enumerated boolean type as shown in the text or the integers 0 and 1.
     For a simple example see bool.cc.  If you
     use an enumerated type or #include <boolean.h> as
     shown in the text you may get a compiler warning message that can be
     ignored.
     
inner cities may have inadvertent locals
Variables are created when they are defined and destroyed when they
     fall out of scope.  There are many places where variables can be defined 
     and unintentionally be within a code block that limits the variables scope.
     
     {   int i;
         cout << i;
         {
            int j;           // j's scope limited to inner code block
            cout << i << j;
         }                   // j falls out of scope here
         cout << i << j;     // ERROR!  j doesn't exist
     }                       // i falls out of scope here
     
leading with zeros can be confusing
Numbers with at least one leading zeros are treated as octal (i.e. base
     8) not decimal (i.e. base 10).  The code below displays  81,121 

     int i = 0121, j = 121;
     cout << i << ',' << j << endl;
     
's' is not "s"
Character values are enclosed in single quotes, whereas strings are
     enclosed in double quotes and are terminated with a NULL character.
     The code below should give a syntax error, but may not.
     
     if ( 's' == "s" )
     


Control Structures

if only == where = but they are not equal
Probably the most common error is using = (assignment op)
     rather than == (equality op).  Since assignment is often legal
     where equality comparison is desired, this error may not create a syntax
     error.  If you ever use assignment where equality would be expected,
     comment your code to say the assignment was intentional.
     
     if ( apples = oranges )  // OOPS! or is this intentional?
     
&& and || are "and" and "or" but not & and |
Like equality comparisons, logical "and" and logical "or" must use
     the appropriate symbol doubled with no space between.
     
greatest greater great
When a sequence of comparisons (i.e ==, <, <=, >, >=) are made you can
     only compare two things at a time and must join the comparisons using logical
     "and".  The conditions below may look good but evaluate to false.
     
     if ( 33 > 22 > 11 )    // should be: (33 > 22) && (22 > 11)
     if ( 11 == 11 == 11 )  // should be: (11 == 11) && (11 == 11)
     
compounding the problem
Only a single statement follows as the body of most control structures
     unless you compound the statements using a statement block.  It is a good
     practice to always use { }.
     
     if ( apples == oranges )
        cout << "Ok, but can be dangerous." << endl;
     else
     {
        cout << "do one thing" << endl;
        do_another( thing );
     }
     
to break or not to break
A break; statement must follow every case in a switch
     statement, unless you intend to flow through to the next case.  It is a
     good practice to even put a break after the last case.
     
     switch ( menu_choice )
     {
      case 'a':           // intentional flow through to next case
      case 'A':
         add( item );     // accidental flow through to next case
      case 'd':           // intentional flow through to next case
      case 'D':
         delete( item );
         break;           // good practice
     }
     
the bodyless loop
A misplaced semicolon can behead a loop.  In the examples below the
     loops have a NULL body due to the extra semicolon, and the compiler won't
     complain.
     
     for ( i = 0; i < MAX; i++ );   // <- see the extra semicolon?
     {
        do_something( useful );
     }
     while ( i < MAX );             // <- see the extra semicolon?
     {
        do_something( useful );
     }
     
scoping for counters
The scoping rules for for loops have changed to the new
     ANSI rules.  This is generating many warning messages for programs that mix
     old and new styles, and sometimes results in syntax errors.  For more detail
     see code example.  I recommend the
     following to eliminate problems:
     
Loop counters that are used outside the loop body are defined
          outside of the loop.

     int i, j;
     for (i=1, j=-1; i<11; i++, j--)
        cout << i << j;       // <- counter used in loop body
     cout << endl << i << ',' << j << endl; // <- and outside
          
Loop counters that are used only inside of the loop body can be
	  defined in the for loop in the manner shown below.

     // defines TWO local counters m,n that are used only inside loop
     for (int m=1, n=-1; m<11; m++, n--)
        cout << m << n;
          
Using the old style of defining two loop counters may give syntax
	  errors and should be avoided.

     // notice the ||| second int below?
     //            vvv
     for (int m=1, int n=-1; m<11; m++, n--)
        cout << m << n;
          



Basic Data Structures

start indexing at 0
Array indices always begin at 0.  The example below creates a array
     with 11 elements with the first at index 0 and the last at index 10.
     
     int a[11];
     a[0]  =  121;
     a[11] = 1331;     // ERROR! last index is 10
     
your out of bounds
There is nothing to prevent your from indexing beyond the bounds of
     an array, except perhaps that your program may misbehave intermittently
     or even crash.  Unfortunately the compiler doesn't verify that your
     indices are in range, so programs will compile with bad indices.
     
a[i,j] is like being out of your element
Elements of multidimensional arrays are accessed by
     a[i][j].  However, a[i,j] is legal!  The
     comma is an operator that evaluates each operand and results in the value
     of the right-hand operand.  This means a[i,j] is the same as
     a[j], which does not access the element of the two dimensional
     array as you intended.
     
arrays are not the same
Unlike all other data types (e.g. int, char, structs), arrays by default
     are passed to functions by reference, and can not be returned from a
     function using a return statement.
     
classes end in a semicolon
Don't forget to end your class definitions with a semicolon!
     
     class Example
     {
     };      // <- don't forget this
     


Functions

mismatched arguments
The formal arguments listed in a function's header and prototype must
     match in order, number, and type.  If there is a mismatch you may get
     a syntax error from the compiler or an undefined symbol error from the
     linker.  Additionally, reference and constant arguments must match.
     
no arguing about parentheses
Even when a function takes no arguments, you must still include the
     ( )s when calling the function, as well as in the prototype
     and the function header.  Leaving the parentheses out may not cause a
     syntax error because a function name by itself refers to the function's
     address.  The example below shows this:
     
     void display();
     int main()
     {
         display;      // OOPS! this doesn't call the function
         //...
     }
     int display()
     {
         cout << "something" << endl;
     }
     
arrays can cause troubles, see above
