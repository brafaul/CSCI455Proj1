at the start of class.



Name
         (printed):

Name (signed):


(1) T/F, 10 points, 1 point each
Note: The complete SAL instruction set is given in
Appendix A of the textbook, page 386.
(a) all variables in SAL programs are global
(b) the SAL statement "get x" works the same for all types of "x"

(c) the label "b" could be used for a variable in a SAL program

(d) variables must be declared before they are used in SAL
programs
(e) when executed, the SAL statement "b (ret)" will cause a branch
to the SAL statement labeled by "ret:"
(f) when executed, the SAL statement "j ret" will cause a branch
to the SAL statement labeled by "ret:"
(g) every SAL program must have a "__start:" label in it somewhere

(h) "done" is part of the SAL instruction set
(i) "rem" is used to put a remark or comment in a SAL program
(j) type declarations are made in SAL programs so that type
checking can be done by the assembler
 
(2) 2 points
In a single sentence, explain what "computer
architecture" means.
 
 
(3) 8 points
Translate the following C code into the equivalent SAL
statements. Assume that all variables are of C type "int."
if ((A > 0 ) || ( B == 1 )) {
C = A + B * 5;

} else {
A++;
B = ( A / B ) % C;
}
