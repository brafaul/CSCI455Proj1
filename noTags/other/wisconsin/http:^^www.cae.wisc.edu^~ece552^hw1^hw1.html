      Design a fully synchronous sequential circuit  match,
      to detect a pattern 3201 in a sequence of digits ( 0, 1, 2, 3). 
      This circuit has
      two input lines (for the encoded input digits), a  clock input,
      and a  reset input. The circuit has one output called  det.
      The  reset input is used to initialize  match to an all 
      zero state.  Thus on application of  reset = high, 
      all the flip-flops in the circuit are set to zero states on occurrence 
      of the appropriate edge of the  clock.
      If the  reset is high the output  det remains low 
      irrespective of the input sequence.  
      If  reset is low,  det goes high when the above pattern is 
      found in  the input sequence and the circuit continues to look for
      another occurrence the same pattern. The output  det remains high  for
      at least one-half (1/2) clock cycle 
      (see more on this in the next paragraph) and then it reverts to look for
      the next occurrence for the pattern 3201.

      The  clock signal has a period of 100ns and it is low 
      from 0 to 50ns and high from 50 to 100ns.
      All input signals, namely the signals associated with the input digits
      and the  reset signal, change only in the window 
      +/- 0.1ns of the rising edge of  clock. 
      The output  det must go 
      high as soon as the last 1 of the pattern arrives 
      (i.e., well before the next falling edge of the  clock) 
      and remain high till
      the falling edge of the clock.

      Design your circuit with appropriate state assignment. 
      Use fewest number of states and state-variables to complete your design.
      Remember that the circuit is fully synchronous and the  reset
      input does not reset the flip-flops asynchronously.

      Assume that the flip-flops have a small non-zero 
      setup time and a zero hold time. In your submission include
      the state table, provide the sate assignment, schematic, force files 
      showing your test sequence, 
      and a well commented Quicksim output for your test sequence. 
      Also submit a clear documentation explaining the steps you used to
      arrive at the design.

      Your work that is to be submitted for this problem should be 
       no more than five pages. Thus provide all the necessary
      information in reasonably compact manner with appropriate comments.
