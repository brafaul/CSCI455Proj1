Center for Parallel Optimization
Madison, Wisconsin



Research Assistant

Conducting basic research  into several ways in which structure 
can be exploited to make solutions of mathematical programs more
efficient.  This research includes partitioning constraint matrices
into arrowhead matrices which can be used in parallel solvers.  The
research also includes computational differentiation of objective
and constraint functions to translate nonlinear programs to other
problem formats that may be solved more efficiently than the original
nonlinear program.
