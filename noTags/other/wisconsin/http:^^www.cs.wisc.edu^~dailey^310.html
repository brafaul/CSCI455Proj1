 To avoid losing 5 pts from your homework assignments, please
put your name and your lab section number (for example: Lab 305) in the
upper right hand corner of your assignments.  This is how the TA's know
where to return your assignment. Also, staple your papers in the left hand
corner (pages can get lost).
