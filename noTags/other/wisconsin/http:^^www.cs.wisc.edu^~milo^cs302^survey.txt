Class Survey
Due Monday, September 9, 1996


This assignment is to make sure that you are familiar with email and also 
to let me know a little bit more about you. 

I would like you to attach a picture of yourself to a 8.5" x 11" sheet of
paper, label it clearly with your name and turn it in.  It should be a
picture that is recent enough so that the picture looks similar to what
you do now.  (I warned you about this on Wednesday, so no excuses.)

I am terrible with names.  However, I hope that with the pictures to assist 
me in learning your names, I will quickly know you all by name. 

In addition, send me an email at milo@cs.wisc.edu with brief 
answers to the following questions about yourself:


  Name
    E-mail address
    Year in school (Senior, Junior, etc)
    Planned major, if you have not chosen a major yet, that's fine.
    Past computer and computer programming experience.
    Motivation for taking this class.  What do you want to get out of 
this class?
    One really interesting and unique thing about you that will help 
be remember you.  The stranger the better.


This would also be a good time to express any concerns about the items 
covered under "Other Educational Concerns" on the general information sheet.
