The SimpleScalar Architectural Research Tool Set
What is the SimpleScalar tool set? 
This tool set consists of compiler, assembler, linker and simulation 
tools for the SimpleScalar architecture.  With this tool set, the user can
simulate real programs on a range of modern processors and systems, using
fast execution-driven simulation.  We provide simulators ranging from a fast
functional simulator to a detailed, slower out-of-order issue system.
The tool set is partly derived from the GNU software development tools. It 
provides researchers with an easily extensible, portable, high-performance 
test bed for systems design.  
Who wrote the SimpleScalar tool set? 
Much of the compiler tools are simply ports of the GNU software 
development tools to the SimpleScalar architecture. The ports as well 
as the simulators were written by Todd Austin (while he was a
Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working in the
Multiscalar Group under Guri Sohi; he is now with Intel Corp.). 
Steve Bennett wrote the SimpleScalar x86 simulator.  The tool set is now
supported by Doug Burger, who wrote the documentation as well.
The development of this code was supported by grants from the National 
Science Foundation (grant CCR-9303030 plus software capitalization
supplement) and the Office of Naval Research (grant N00014-93-1-0465).
On which platforms does it run?
SimpleScalar should port easily to any 32-bit flavor of UNIX, particularly those 
that support POSIX-compliant syscalls.  The full release has so far been
successfully installed on Sparcs running SunOS and Solaris, as well as 
a Pentium Pro machine running Linux.
How can I keep informed as to new releases and announcements?
We have set up a SimpleScalar mailing list.  To subscribe, send e-mail to
majordomo@cs.wisc.edu, with the message body (not the subject header)
containing subscribe simplescalar.
