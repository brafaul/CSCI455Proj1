The Vectra Lab



The Vectra Lab
The Hottest Computer Science PC lab in the building 
[The Only Computer Science PC lab in the building]





The Vectra Lab (and B240 combined) consist of 70 HP vectra 486/66Ns. 
Each vectra holds the basic DOS operating system and enough to connect
to the Novell server WILEY.
MS Windows 3.11  and other application programs as well as user files are
stored on this server. Thus, access to these files can only be obtained after
the proper login procedure.

Wiley currently stores accounts for some CS 110, CS 132,CS 302,CS 364 sections.
New users activate their accounts by running the newuser program.

This page is not intended to answer the general course related questions of a 
student.  The TAs and Consultans have probably written much better pages to 
answer such questions. For CS 302 questions, you could take a look at the
CS 302 frequently asked questions page. CS 132 students can take a look at 
the CS 132 page.
