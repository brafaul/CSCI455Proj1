CS110: Program #2



Program #3 -- Family Vacation Planning Program

Due Date

This assignment is due on Thursday, October 10th
Note that this program is worth 25% of your grade; the previous two
assignments were only worth 20% each.
Introduction
This assignment is meant to give you practice using functions; passing
parameters by value and by reference; return statements;  if/else
statements and  switch statements.

The story so far: You've been hired by HAPPY FAMILY travel agency to
create a reservation system.  The basic idea of this program is to aid the
user to estimate the cost of her/his family vacation.  Even though you
have had only a month of C++, your employers insist you complete the
project by the stated deadline.

But there is a silver lining.  A previous programmer (now unemployed)
had previously tried (unsuccessfully) to write the program last year -- and
he left notes!  A skeleton program!  Just the thing to get you started.
Using this outline code, and a list of guidelines required by your
employers, you must now begin your plan of attack ...
Your program will need to be "full-featured" and allow the user to:

 buy airplane tickets
   book hotel rooms
   reserve rental cars


To do this, you will need to implement the five functions:

userChoice(), 
bookTickets(), 
bookRooms(),
reserveCars(), and 
printReceipt() 

which are outlined below. The skeleton code follows:

// a header comment should go here

// include statements should go here

// function prototypes
char   userInput();
char   userChoice(int& numChildren, int& numAdults);
double bookTickets(int numChildren, int numAdults);    // returns ticket cost
double bookRooms();                                    // returns room cost
double reserveCars();                                  // returns car rental cost
void printReceipt(double totalCost);                   // displays total cost

void main()      // main should just call the auxiliary functions
{                // and must be very short!

}

//gets input after a Y/N question
char userInput()
{
	char response;
	cin >> response;
	if ((response == 'y')||(response == 'Y'))
		return 'y';
	else
	    if ((response == 'n')||(response == 'N'))
		return 'n';
	    else
		{
		     cout<<"Bad Input--expected Y or N and you typed: "<<response<<<endl;
		     cout<<"shame on you! Aborting program...."<<endl;
		     exit(0);
		}
}





char userChoice(int& numChildren, int& numAdults)
{
  char response; // user's response 


  return response;    	                                       
}

double bookTickets(int numChildren, // returns plane tix cost
                   int numAdults)   
{
  const int HAWAII      = 1;     // only three destinations
  const int GREECE = 2;     // are necessary for this program       
  const int INDIA     = 3;     // -- do more if you want

  
}

double bookRooms()               // returns room cost
{
  const int MARRIOT      = 1;     // hotels -- again, three minimum
  const int DAYS_INN     = 2;
  const int MOTEL6      = 3;

  
}

double reserveCars()             // returns car rental price
{
  const int BUDGET        = 1;	 // rental car companies -- three min
  const int ALAMO         = 2;
  const int RENT_A_WRECK  = 3;

  
}

void printReceipt(double totalCost)  // prints out total cost
                                     // (don't cout totals from within main!)
{              


}



Note: You have been supplied with a working function userInput() that accepts
the answer to a Y/N question (and filters out invalid input).  To
greatly simplify your code, you might choose to use it ...



Also since a lot of the above code involves implementing menu-driven 
decisions, you might find the switch statement quite helpful.
Look at the examples of the switch statements we looked at in lecture.

Description of the functions you have to write
Please note that all these functions must behave exactly
as specified.
The userChoice Function

The userChoice function should do the following:

 Prompt the user asking if s/he is interested in any of three
possible vacation destinations.

 Hawaii 
   Greece 
   India  

 If the user enters 'y' indicating YES, you will query for the
number of children and adults in the family and return the user's
response.  (NOTE: the number of children and number of adults are returned
by reference to the main program to be used at a later stage)

   If the user enters 'n', simply return this response


The bookTickets Function

The bookTickets function should do the following:

 Ask the user if s/he wants to buy airline tickets.  
       If the answer is no ('n'), then return 0.0 (no money spent).
   If the answer is yes ('y'), then display the following menu and
       ask for a choice of destination:

         Destination  - PER ADULT		
	1. Hawaii : $672.19
	2. Greece : $900.27
	3. India  : $1599.99
	Please choose a destination (1-3):

Calculate the total air-travel cost. Note that children get a
37% discount.
Return the total cost of the purchased tickets.

The bookRooms Function

The bookRooms function should do the following:

 Ask the user if s/he wants to book hotel rooms.  
       If the answer is no ('n'), then return 0.0 (no money spent).
   If the answer is yes ('y'), then display the following menu and
       ask for a choice of hotel:

	1. Marriot  : $65.00 per night
	2. Days Inn : $45.95 per night
	3. Motel 6  : $36.00 per night
	Please choose a hotel (1-3):

 Ask for the number of rooms to book.
   Ask for the number of nights to stay.
   Calculate and return the total cost of the rooms.

The reserveCars Function

The reserveCars function should do the following:

 Ask the user if s/he wants to reserve any rental cars.
       If the answer is negative, return 0.0 (no money spent).
   If the answer is affirmative, display the following menu and
       ask for a choice of rental car company:

	1. Budget     : $68.52 per day
	2. Alamo      : $72.36 per day
	3. RentAWreck : $25.99 per day
	Please choose a car (1-3):

 Ask for the number of cars they would like to rent.
   Ask for the number of days they would like to rent the car.
   Ask if they would like collision insurance. Collision 
	insurance will add 10% to the car rental cost.
   Calculate and return the total cost of the rentals.

The printReceipt Procedure

The printReceipt procedure should display the total
amount spent at the travel agency.  


The main program

Your main program must be very very short. It should simply call your 
functions at appropriate places. It should work as follows:

 Call userChoice() function:

If function returns 'n' your program must terminate with a thank you
message.

If function returns 'y' your program should call the other functions
bookTickets(), bookRooms(), reserveTickets() and
printReceipt(). It must then terminate with a thank you
message.
If function returns anything other than a 'n' or a 'y' your program
must terminate with an error message. 

Your test cases

You will be required to turn in the screen output generated from three
 program runs. The inputs should cleverly chosen so as to demonstrate
all functionality of your program.

Handing In the Assignment

 Please turn in both an electronic copy of your source code (.cpp)
and your executable program (.exe) into your handin directory. I will be testing each program
with my test cases.  If I do not receive an electronic copy of your source
code and executable, you will lose most of the points. In case your program
does not compile or run correctly, you must, nevertheless, turn in what
you have to get some credit. If your program fails on my test cases you
will receive a low score.
 A printed copy of source code. 

   A printed copy of your three test cases


Items 2 and 3 must be stapled together.
