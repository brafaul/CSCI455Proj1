Scheduling and Synchronization
For each of the following statements, indicate whether you think it is
probably true (T) or probably false (F).
Then give a brief (one sentence) reason.
There is not necessarily a single correct answer to each question, so
your one sentence explanation is the most important part of your answer.


Small time slices always improve the average response time of a system.


 Probably false:
Small time slices will sometimes improve the average response
of the system.
If the slice is too small, the context switching time will start to
dominate the useful computation time and everything (including response
time) will suffer.


Monitors are more powerful than semaphores, because monitors automatically
provide mutual exclusion.


Probably false:
While monitors are usually more convenient to use, they are not more
powerful.
Since you can simulate semaphores with monitors, monitors are at least
as powerful as semaphores.
(Of course, you know that you can also simulate monitors with semaphores,
so they actually are of equal power.)


Process Control Blocks (PCBs) must be stored in the operating
system kernel, where no process can access them.


Probably true:
PCBs must be in a protected part of the memory.
If users (processes) were allowed to access the PCB, they could change scheduling
priorities and perhaps access other processes' memory in an unintended manor.


Shortest Job First (SJF) or Shortest Completion Time First (SCTF)
scheduling is difficult to build on a real operating system.


Probably true:
SCTF scheduling requires knowledge of how much time a process is going to
take.
This requires future knowledge.
You might require a user to specify the maximum amount of time that
a process could run (and kill it if it exceeds this amount), then use a
variant on SCTF.
