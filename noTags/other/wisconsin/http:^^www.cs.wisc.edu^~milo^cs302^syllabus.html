Syllabus


Revised: Sunday, October 6, 1996 

Here is the syllabus.  This is subject to change.  When it does I will 
let you know.  

Note when the exams are.  Test make-ups are offered only in the most 
extreme circumstances, so make sure that you will be able to attend the 
dates listed below. 

Right now I have not decided when program 8 is going to 
be due.  Program 8's due date depends on how large of an assignment it 
is and also how large of a task program 9 will be.  Both program 8 and 
9 will be substantial projects that will be quite time consuming.  To 
compensate for the more intense projects outside of class, the lectures 
will cover material at a somewhat slower rate after the second exam.  I 
will let you know when the due date for program 8 is fixed.
