We refine our parallel supercomputer design ideas
with an execution-driven simulation system
called the 
Wisconsin Wind Tunnel.  It runs a parallel shared-memory
program on a parallel computer (Thinking Machines CM-5) and uses
execution-driven, distributed, discrete-event simulation to accurately
calculate program execution time.  

The project is gets its name from tools--such as the Wisconsin Wind
Tunnel--that allow us to cull the design space of parallel
supercomputers in a manner similar to how aeronautical engineers use
conventional wind tunnels to design airplanes.
