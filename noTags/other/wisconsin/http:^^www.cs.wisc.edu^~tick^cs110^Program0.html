CS 110 Sections 1&2 - Program 0


 Program0


Due Date:
Friday 11/1/96, 5:00 pm
Grade:
4% of your final grade.
Text Covered:
None
Problem Description:
Program0 requires you to do no programming of your own, nor are you required at this point to understand what the program is doing (although it may make a little more sense once you run it). It's simply intended to get you used to using the PC's, MS-DOS, and Microsoft Fortran.

Send me e-mail (tick@cs.wisc.edu) indicating which
email address you send and receive your mail from. 
You need to be registered for this class in order to be given an account on the Vectras. The account will take about 2 days to set-up after you register. If your account won't be set-up yet by the due date of this program, let me know immediately.
Check out the basics of using Fortran on the PC's. This will tell you exactly what to do; just read the following comments below, then follow the steps.


Note that step 10 talks about copying additional files. For this program, you'll want to copy a file called prog0.dat (that's a zero, not the letter O) into your working directory.     

When you type this program in, use your name instead of mine where it appears
near the top of the program. Also, make sure that you type this *exactly*
as you see it. The C's and line #s must be in the very first column, and
the rest (i.e. PROGRAM ZERO, IMPLICIT NONE, etc) must be in column 7...Use
the TAB key to jump to column 7.
Here is the program to type in (step 13):

        PROGRAM ZERO
        IMPLICIT NONE
        CHARACTER NAME*128
        CHARACTER BUFFER*20

        OPEN (UNIT = 1, FILE = 'PROG0.DAT' , STATUS = 'OLD')  

        PRINT *,'Please enter your name: '
        READ '(A)',NAME

2       CONTINUE

           READ(1,4,END=3) BUFFER
4          FORMAT(A)
           PRINT *,BUFFER 
        GOTO 2

3       CONTINUE

        PRINT *, NAME
        CLOSE(UNIT=1)
        STOP
        END
