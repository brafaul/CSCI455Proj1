Quiz 3
Monday, October 28, 1996


This quiz is 20 total points.  Please write legibly.  If I can't read
it, I can't grade it.  You have until 5 minutes after the class period
ends to finish.

Good luck.


 (5 points) Write the struct declaration for a
structure called ``Computer'' which has four member variables: an
integer disk_size, an integer monitor_size, a
character model_type, and a double total_price.

             
 
 (5 points) Rewrite the following function to use switch statement
instead of a nested if-else statement.  Your code should have no if
statements.


int foo(int number, int value) 
{
  if (number == 1) {
    value = value * 2;
  } else if (number == 3) {
    value = value + 10;
  } else if ((number == 4) || (number == 6)) {
    value = value * value;
  } else {
    value = 17;
  }
  return value;
}

     
 
 
- Over - 
 (5 points) What does the following code display to the screen?


#include&ltiostream.h>

int bar(int number, int value) 
{
  if ((number == 1) && (value++ > 0)) {
    return value + 10;
  } else {
    return value;
  }
}

int main() 
{
  cout << bar(0, 0) << endl;
  cout << bar(1, 0) << endl;
  cout << bar(0, 1) << endl;
  cout << bar(1, 1) << endl;
}

 
 
 (5 points) Rewrite the following function to use a while or
do-while loop instead of a for loop.


int factorial(int n) 
{
  int counter, fact = 1;
  for(counter = 1; counter <= n; counter++) {
    fact *= counter;
  }
  return fact;
}
