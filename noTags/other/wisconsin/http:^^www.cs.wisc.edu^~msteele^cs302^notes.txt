CS 302 Section 10 Notes and Examples



CS 302 Section 10 Notes and Examples




Chapter 1-2
Some sample programs which demonstrate material from Ch. 1.3-2.5:

C++ Basics:  (Ch 1.3-2.3,2.5)
Baseball  (Demonstrates basic
C++ structure, declaring and using variables, int vs. double,
char, cin and cout, arithmetic operators,
how to get a double result when dividing two ints, 
commenting)
Dividing Money  (New concepts:
difference between dividing ints and doubles, use of
/ and % (divide and modulus) for integers)  This is similar but not
identical to the program we went over in class.

Flow Control: (Ch 2.4)
Income Taxes  (New concepts:
if and if-else statements, nested if
statements, use of const for constants)  This is similar
but not identical to the program we went over in class.
Multiplication Tables  (New
concepts:  while and do-while loops)


Chapter 3
Some sample programs that demonstrate material from Ch. 3:

Force Equation  (New concepts:
functions, prototypes vs. definitions, formal vs. actual parameters)
This is similar but not identical to the program we went over in 
class.
A Confusing Example  (New concepts:
names of formal and actual parameters do not need to match, using local
variables in functions)
Area of Shapes  (New concepts: 
function name overloading)  This is the program we went over in
class.


Chapter 4
Some sample programs that demonstrate material from Ch. 4:

Compass Headings  (New concepts:
void functions, precondition/postcondition, re-prompting user for valid
input, a userful thing to use the % operator for)
Making Change  (New concepts: 
call-by-reference, good use of global constants)  This program is
similar but not identical to the program we wrote together in class.
The Really Evil Simpsons Program
(Concepts:  pass-by-reference vs. pass-by-value, functions calling other
functions, scope of local variables and pass-by-value variables, why
not to use global variables)  This is the example we did in class.


Chapter 5
Some sample programs that demonstrate material from Ch. 5:

Making a Grid of Numbers (New concepts:
opening files, checking that files were opened sucessfully, closing files,
formatting output)
Copying Files (New concepts: using get
and put for character I/O, using the eof function)


Chapter 7
Some sample programs that demonstrate material from Ch. 7:

Voting  (New concepts:  switch
statements, width output manipulator inside of an output stream)  This
is a fleshed out version of an example I went through in class.
Rock, Paper, Scissors  (New concepts:
enum for enumerated types, for loops, nested
switch statements)


Chapter 6
Some sample programs that demonstrate material from Ch. 6:

These two programs do the exact same thing.  The first example uses
a struct, the second example uses a class.
Increment the Date with a Struct  (New
concepts:  declaring & initializing structs, passing 
structs as arguments to functions and using them as return types
from functions, using an enum type like an integer)  This
is a fleshed out version of an example I went through in class
Increment the Date with a Class
(New concepts:  declaring a class,
writing member functions for a class, initializing a class with a
constructor)  This is a fleshed out version of an example I went 
through in class

The Electric Company  (New concepts:
overloading constructor functions, Abstract Data Types)  This is a
fleshed out version of an example I went through in class


Chapter 9
Some sample programs that demonstrate material from Ch. 6:

Points Per Game  (New concepts:
declaring, initializing, and using an array, using a partially
filled array, passing an entire array as an argument to a function)
Coming soon... the Library Class example...

Make sure you also understand the searching and sorting 
examples in the text book.
