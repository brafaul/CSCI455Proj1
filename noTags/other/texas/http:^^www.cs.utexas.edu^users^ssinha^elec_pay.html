Electronic Payment Systems





Electronic Payment Systems


-by  Gokul Rajaram  and Santanu Sinha.


Here are most of the references for my talk on electronic payment systems.
Time permitting, I should talk about iKP, anonymous credit cards,
untraceable cash, 
micropayments and finally CAFE. The papers for these are in "/u/ssinha/pub/elec_pay".


Listing of files in /u/ssinha/pub/elec_pay :

 AJSW96.ps.gz : "Electronic Payment Systems"
 BBCM1_94CafeEsorics.ps.gz : "The ESPRIT Project CAFE - High Security Digital Payment Systems"
 BuePf_89.ps.gz : "Digital Payment Systems  Enabling Security and Unobservability"
 HSW96.ps.gz : "Micro-Payments based on iKP"
 collude.ps.gz : "Anonymous Credit Cards and its Collusion Analysis"
 ikp.ps.gz : "iKP - A Family of Secure Electronic Payment Protocols"
 wcf.ps.gz : "Why Cryptosystems Fail"
 gokul.ps.gz : Gokul's transparencies for the talk
 ssinha.ps.gz : My transparencies for the talk


The two papers I had to read in hard copy were :

Big Brother Obsolete" : Communications of the ACM Oct 1985 Vol 28 #10

Stefan Brands : "Untraceable Off-line Cash in Wallet with Observers"
Lecture Notes in Computer Science 773 , Advances in Cryptology, CRYPTO '93

As is usual on the net, there is far too much information/junk around. So I am
just adding all my bookmarks regarding E-commerce, which are not guaranteed to
contain anything useful.
