Ken Harker - Cyberspace Advocacy


Ken Harker - 
Cyberspace Advocacy


I am a member of the Association for Computing
Machinery, and I have been a member of the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation when my finances permitted.  I support many 
of the ideas espoused by the League for Programming Freedom, although I am not 
a member.  I try to be as actively involved in promoting civil liberties in 
cyberspace as my spare time allows.  I am a strong supporter of free, strong, 
and open public key encryption.  Ask me about PGP 
(Pretty Good Privacy) encryption.
