What's New at the QR Group

What's New at the QR Group

These are recent changes.  See the Qualitative
Reasoning Research Group home page for a more complete description
of our work, in several areas.  

Another review of the QR Book.

(12-3-96)  See the  QR book page for other reviews.


 
        Andrew Frank, Int. J. of Geographic Information Systems
10(2), March 1996, pages 242-243. 
This book may become a very important book for Geographic Systems
and for geography in general, despite the fact, that it does not
discuss anything geographical or spatial in its 400 pages.  ...  It
must be hoped that many geographers use the methods to model
geographical processes and to explore the dynamic behavior of systems
in physical and human geography.  Many M.Sc. or Ph.D. thesis could
benefit from the rigor of the method and the application of the
software.  Modeling of dynamic systems - a la Forrester's Urban
Dynamics - become feasible, even in the absence of detailed
quantitative knowledge.

but is a much longer file, and fails to display reasonably in ghostview,
though it seems to print correctly.

Computing Reviews, and AI Magazine.

 

QSIM in Parallel Hardware

 (1-11-96)  Added to Qsim Users page.  

A significant barrier to application of QSIM to large-scale problems is the
efficiency of qualitative simulation.  Recently, a group at T.U. Graz in Austria
have designed and implemented a special-purpose parallel hardware architecture
for qualitative simulation.  See their Web page and published papers.
