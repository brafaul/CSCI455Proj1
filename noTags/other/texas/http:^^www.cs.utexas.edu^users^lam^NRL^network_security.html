 Network Security
 Network Security


To enhance the security of networked systems, we proposed a security 
architecture together with novel protocols for authentication, 
called Texas Authentication Protocols (TAPs), and a new language 
for authorization, called Generalized Access Control List (GACL).  
A proof methodology for verifying authentication protocols based upon
state transition semantics has been developed.  A high level abstraction
for secure network programming (SNP), designed to resemble a socket interface,
has been implemented.
