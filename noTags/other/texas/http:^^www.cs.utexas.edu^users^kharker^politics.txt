Ken Harker - Politics


Ken Harker - 
Politics


I am a semi-active member of the Republican party, and have previously 
served as Secretary and Acting President of Republicans at Dartmouth.  I 
believe in fiscal conservatism, the support of civil liberties, the promotion 
of gay rights, and the validity of Keynesian economic theory.  I am also an 
internationalist, support free trade, and support a stronger United Nations.  
I believe the Republican Party should be a more accepting, tolerant, and 
diverse political party than it is currently generally perceived to be.
I really wanted to see 
General Colin 
Powell (ret.) run for the Republican nomination for the Presidency in 
1996.
