Course Topics
  The goal of this course is to present a number of important ideas in
  distributed computing and provide rigorous methods for reasoning about
  distributed programs. The topics are:
  
 Distributed detection algorithms
     Distributed resource allocation
     Logical clocks
     Global snapshot
     Logics for reasoning about distributed algorithms
     Safety and progress
     Program composition
     Distributed program construction
  

Discussion Sessions
  The discussion sessions will allow us to discuss topics presented in class in
  detail and on occasion to cover background material. Weekly handouts 
  containing exercises will be distributed (in class and on the Web) and 
  selected solutions will be 
  presented during the discussion sessions. You only need attend one of the
  weekly sessions; both cover the same material.

  Study Groups
  We recommend that you organize yourselves into study groups of five or six
  students who meet once a week to discuss the course. You should review the
  lectures, do the readings, and attempt the homework assignments before 
  meeting as a group.

  Grading system

First exam = 25%

Announcements

All students should send e-mail to  
        Panagiotis (Peter) Manolios , so a list of e-mail addresses can be
        compiled.
    The newsgroup  utexas.class.cs380d 
        has been set up to facilitate discussion between class members.
    Drop dates: Please consult the course schedule to learn the
        the last dates to drop the course without academic penalty. 
    Updated info on rooms and times of exams
In a few weeks the University Co-op will begin the process of returning
	unsold Fall textbooks to the publishers, so if you want to purchase any
	of the recommended books and have not yet done so, now is the time.
