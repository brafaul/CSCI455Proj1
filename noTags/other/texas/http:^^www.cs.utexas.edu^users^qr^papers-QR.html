Overviews 
The QR book is now the definitive presentation of the QSIM approach
to qualitative reasoning. The papers it supercedes are indicated below.

MA: MIT Press. 

The two AIJ papers are from a special retrospective issue, reflecting
on the status of research in this area.

50 volumes of the Artificial Intelligence Journal, hence the two
AIJ 1993 retrospectives.

Clancy, Daniel J. and Kuipers, Benjamin J. Behavior
abstraction for tractable simulation. Proceedings from the Seventh
International Workshop on Qualitative Reasoning, May 1993.
Describes two techniques for reducing intractable branching in qualitative
simulations. Chatter box abstraction eliminates chatter by performing a
focused envisionment while Behavior Aggregation eliminations event occurrence
branching.

decomposition and simulation. In Working Papers of the Eighth
International Workshop on Qualitative Reasoning about Physical Systems
(QR-94), Nara, Japan. 
Describes a simulation technique that uses a cross between a state-based
representation and a history-based representation. Models are decomposed
into components and then each component is simulated separately. Temporal
correlations between variables within different components is eliminated
thus reducing many irrelevant distinctions within the behavioral description.

the use of TeQSIM to address specific tasks. The manuscript "Focusing
qualitative simulation using temporal logic" is an extension of the
paper published in TIME-96. This paper provides a detailed description
of the syntax and semantics of the temporal logic along with a formal description
of the model checking algorithm with soundness and completeness theorms.
