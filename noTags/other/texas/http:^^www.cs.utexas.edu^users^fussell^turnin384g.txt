 Using turnin 

Electronic submission of programming assignments (turnin)

Use the command `turnin' in /p/bin.

Usage:

turnin -submit fussell cs384g `files'

where `files' is the list of files that you want to submit.

Please do include the makefile and a README file describing what platform
the makefile is for (Sun4/Solaris/AIX). Use the README file to provide
any other information that you want to. You might want to state what
assumptions you are making, what the user can/cannot do, etc.

If you have any problems, check out the man page on turnin in /p/man (type: man
-M /p/man turnin).
