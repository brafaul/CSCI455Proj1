STL Manual and Source


Standard Template Library Manual and Source

Last updated 09/21/96


The Standard Template Library (STL) was developed at HP Labs, and has
been adopted by the ANSI C++ Standards Committe for inclusion in the
standard C++ library.  Some compilers are unable to compile the source
code for this library as provided here. If you are using GNU C++, then
it comes with a compatible version of STL in libstdc++., so you should
use that version of STL.  Microsoft Visual C++ also ships with STL
bundled. Borland C++ 4.5 or greater should have no problems compiling
the STL source code here.

If you are on Unix, get the self-extracting shell archive (.shar) files. If
you are on a PC, get the .zip files.
