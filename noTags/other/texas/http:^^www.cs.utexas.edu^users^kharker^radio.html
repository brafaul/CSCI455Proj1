Ken Harker KM5FA - Amateur Radio


Ken Harker KM5FA - 
Amateur Radio


I have been an Amateur Radio operator since August, 1993, when I earned a 
Technician class license with HF Priveleges and the callsign N1PVB.  I 
currently hold an Advanced class license and the callsign
KM5FA.  I am the current acting president of the 
University of Texas Amateur 
Radio Club, W5EHM.  

Main Activities
I am always looking to try new things in Amateur Radio.  Below are some 
activities I find most enjoyable.  In addition to those below, I have also 
been known to operate FM voice on the 6m, 2m, and 70cm bands, chase DX stations
on the HF bands, use Amateur Radio satellites, and enjoy SWL.


Packet Radio
    I network my Macintosh Quadra 660AV with other Amateur Radio operators 
    on the 2m and 70cm bands using a 1200bps AFSK radio modem terminal node 
    controller (TNC).  I look forward to seeing the results of the TAPR STA
    on the use of Spread Spectrum technology in the Amateur Radio bands above
    50MHz primarily for high-speed digital Metropolitan Area Networking.  
  

VHF Weak Signal DX
    I enjoy working DX stations on the 6m and 2m bands using SSB and CW modes.
    Over the summer of 1996, I helped W5EHM earn VHF/UHF Century Club (VUCC) 
    status on 6m, by contacting other Amateur Radio stations in over 100 
    different "grid squares."  I also enjoy working other stations using 
    "meteor scatter" propagation.
  

Contesting
    I try to operate all the VHF+ contests that I am able to, and I have helped
    W5EHM win the South Texas (STX) section as a multi-operator station.  I 
    also enjoyed helping W5EHM take fourth place overall in the 1996 
    Collegiate 
    Championships.
