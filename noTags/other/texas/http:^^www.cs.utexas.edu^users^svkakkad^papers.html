The Texas Persistent Store

Texas is an easy-to-use persistent storage system for C++. It supports
large addresses efficiently on standard hardware, using a technique
called pointer swizzling at page fault time.

Efficient, Portable Persistent Store. In  Persistent Object
Systems: Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Persistent
Object Systems, San Miniato, Italy, September 1992, pages

This paper provides a detailed description of Texas, its motivations,
and its algorithms.
