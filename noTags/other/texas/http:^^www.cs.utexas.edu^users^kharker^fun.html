Ken Harker - Fun Stuff


Ken Harker - 
Fun Stuff


Believe it or not, PhD students not only work hard, we manage to have fun, 
too (on occasion.)  In particular, I have really enjoyed my greek house at 
Dartmouth College, 
Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity.
  I still keep in touch with many of my brothers across the United States 
and the world.
