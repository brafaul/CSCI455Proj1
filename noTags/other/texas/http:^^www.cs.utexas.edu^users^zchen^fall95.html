 Wonderful events 


I had been baptised on Nov. 19, 1995 and joined Hyde Park Baptist Church.

I spent a good time on my Birthday Party. We had a nice dinner at my home and went to Karaok at Hunan Palace. This reminded me of my life in my hometown - Guangzhou.
A bunch of my friends took part in the party:
 -My workmates from Mathematics Department: Hongqiu, Yue
 -My classmates from Computer Sciences Department: Tong Wang, Zhengxiong
 -My churchmates from Hyde Park Chinese Mission: Tong Zhang, Catherine
 -My roommate from Nursing School: Hsueh-Fen
 -My schoolmate from Zhongshan University: Xinyue
They gave me happiness and warmth. Thanx to them!


I went to San Diego (a beautiful city at Pacific shore) on my winter holidays.
