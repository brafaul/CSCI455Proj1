Software System:
The Boyer-Moore theorem-proving system (also known as Nqthm) may be
obtained by anonymous ftp from Internet site ftp.cli.com.  The most
recent release of this program occurred in January, 1994.  To obtain a
copy, fetch the file /pub/nqthm/nqthm-1992/README and follow the
directions therein.  The Common Lisp sources for the system are
included in the release.  The most recent release includes many
mechanically-checked theorems formulated by Bevier, Boyer, Brock,
Bronstein, Cowles, Flatau, Hunt, Kaufmann, Kunen, Moore, Nagayama,
Russinoff, Shankar, Talcott, Wilding, Yu, and others.  Altogether, the
the most recent release, including the examples and documentation,
comprises approximately 15 megabytes.  Running the theorem-prover on
these examples generates approximately 140 megabytes of readable
proofs.

An alternative site for the sources is  here .
