Ph. D. Students


Ph. D. Students:

All degrees were in computer sciences unless noted "mathematics".
Co-supervisors names are given in parentheses.  All degrees were
awarded by the University of Texas at Austin (UT).  All UT
dissertations are available for inspection at the PCL library on the
UT campus and may also be purchased from University Microfilms, 300
