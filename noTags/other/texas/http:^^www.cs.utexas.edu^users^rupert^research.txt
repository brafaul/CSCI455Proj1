My First Experience With Research


During the Fall of 1994, I had a chance to work with 
 Dr. Risto Miikkulainen  on
an original research project on  Natural Languaging Processing  using Neural Network.

The project is to build a system that is capable of building global 
distributed representations for a large corpora.  The current system built
is quite successful in capturing the regularities of the words' usage within
a small corpora of artifical data.  And, we are trying to extend the current
system to build representations for words of natural data such as the WSJ 
(Wall Street Journal) on a large corpora.
