John B. Chambers: UTCS Computer Facilities



UTCS: Computer Facilities


I've been tinkering with Unix systems since 1977, 
and have been involved with 
USENIX
and the greater Unix community on and off since 1982.
Along the way, I've worked at the Geotronics Corporation (Austin),
the 

University of Texas Medical Branch
(Galveston),
the

MCC research consortium
(Austin),
and as an independent software contractor.


Since 1987 I've been employed at the
Department of Computer Sciences
at
The University of Texas at Austin
as a

Senior Operating Systems Specialist
in the Unix facilities group.
Among other projects, I wrote, and still maintain, custom DBMS software
for the departmental user and inventory databases.
I've also administered our DEC systems (MIPS/Ultrix and Alpha/OSF1),
and I've been the acting UTCS webmaster
since January 1995.



The full-time technical staff at UTCS are:


    Patti Spencer,
	Technical Coordinator for Equipment and Facilities



John Chambers,
	Senior Operating Systems Specialist

    Alan Haggard,
	Microcomputer Applications Specialist

    Pat Horne,
	Computer Systems Development Specialist

    Fletcher Mattox,
	Senior Operating Systems Specialist

    Tommy McGuire,
	Computer Programmer

    Boyd Merworth,

Kay Nettle,

Toren Smith,
	Computer Equipment Maintenance Specialist

    Scott Sutcliffe,
	Senior Computer Equipment Maintenance Technician



Some 

facilities information and frequently asked questions
may be found on the departmental WWW server.
If you have other Unix facilities questions or problems, 
you can reach us by email at 
unix@cs.utexas.edu.
For help with other problems, you should send e-mail to the appropriate
UTCS support mailing list (all are @cs.utexas.edu, of course):

It may take much longer for your mail to be routed to the right 
person(s) if you mail to individual staff members instead of using a
mailing list.


The UTCS department staff does not deal with the University facilities.
Such problems must be handled by calling the UT Physical Plant:

    Physical Plant planning and scheduling,
    for problems with UT buildings, plumbing, flooding,
    heating and cooling, light bulbs, insects, etc.
    
    Also:
    



          Fax
          TxMail
