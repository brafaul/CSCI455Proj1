RoboKreta-Besar and RoboKreta-Kicik are two autonomous intelligent toy
cars built using the chassis and motors of two fast radio-controlled
(RC) toy racing cars. Brains based on the MIT 6.270 and miniboard
controller boards are placed in the cars. They are still under
metamorphosis and they should be ready for their debut in upcoming
Robofest.
