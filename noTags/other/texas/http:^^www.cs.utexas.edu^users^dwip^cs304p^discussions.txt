Lab and Discussion Sessions




Lab and Discussion sessions

 

This page will contain the notes on the lab and discussion session for each week.
The discussion topic can be found in  topic of the week  and the TA
assignment for the labs and discussions can be found in 
lab-discussion schedule . 
We will normally try to give a brief sketch of the session beforehand. So
you might want to check this page periodically. In any case, the notes for the
stuff covered on Mondays and Wednesdays will be available here including the
solutions to the prgrams assigned in the discussion sessions.
