Cover photo:  Battle Hall, erected in 1911 and named in honor of  
Professor William James Battle (1870-1955),  was 
UT's first library building. Architect Cass Gilbert, 
inspired by buildings in Zaragoza, Spain, 
created a Spanish renaissance building with ornamental cornices, 
wide projecting eaves, and a high tiled roof. 
Considered by many to be the most beautiful building on campus, 
the high arched windows provide light to the second 
floor reading room. Battle Hall currently houses offices and 
the library of the College of Architecture.
