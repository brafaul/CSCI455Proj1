 OS and Network support for video services
 OS and Network support for video services


To support video services on packet switching networks, we are investigating
the design and implementation of operating system techniques,
transport protocols, and network switches 
to enable various types of performance guarantees.  Motivated by variable bit
rate video which has very large picture-to-picture rate fluctuations, we 
proposed a new model for packet video.  In the model, we have retained the 
basic notion of a flow.  Each flow, however, is a sequence of bursts, each 
of which represents an encoded picture.  



We have designed an efficient algorithm, called Burst Scheduling, for switching 
the transmission of video flows and other types of traffic (e.g., data and audio) 
in a packet switch.  Burst Scheduling networks provide end-to-end delay 
guarantees for packets and delay jitter guarantees for bursts to video flows 
that satisfy a flow specification.  They have the desirable property that 
guarantees provided to a particular video flow are independent of the behavior 
of other traffic flows sharing the network, and are thus unaffected by the
presence of aggressive or misbehaving traffic sources.
