Ken Harker - Babylon 5


Ken Harker - 
Babylon 5


Babylon 5 is really the only television show that I watch regularly. 
It is beyond a doubt one of the highest quality shows on the air.  The show is 
unique among the offerings currently on television, in that it is planned 
along a five year "story arc" in which each episode, while standing on its 
own, contributes to the big picture.  Babylon 5 has already won two 
Emmy Awards for its high quality production, and has been nominated for several
more.  The special effects on the show are incredible, literally setting 
the standards by which to judge other shows!
