UT Intelligent Robotics Research

Spatial reasoning and intelligent robotics based on the  Spatial Semantic Hierarchy, has been a
focus for research in the 
Qualitative Reasoning group.  

Most of our work has concentrated on mobile robot exploration and
mapping of previously unknown environments.  We have used a number of
different simulated robots, and are now working with several types of
 physical robots.  

We have recently been exploring new methods for 

real-time active vision, primarily but not exclusively motivated
by the navigational needs of a mobile robot.  

Work on  heterogeneous control
(our approach to fuzzy control, supporting validation via qualitative
simulation), is also relevant to the robotics research.

 The version of the PS file currently available (7-16-96) is
missing the two figures.  I'll fix it as soon as possible.
    There is a 

Word version of the paper that includes the figures,
but is a much longer file, and fails to display reasonably in ghostview,
though it seems to print correctly.
