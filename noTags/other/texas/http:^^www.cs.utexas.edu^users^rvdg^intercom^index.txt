Introduction


This page describes the second release of the Interprocessor Collective
Communications (InterCom) Library, iCC release R2.1.0.  This library
is the result of an ongoing collaboration between David Payne (Intel
SSD), Lance Shuler (Sandia National Laboratories), Robert van de
Geijn (University of Texas at Austin), and Jerrell Watts (California
Institute of Technology), funded by the Intel Research Council, and 
Intel SSD.  Previous contributors to this effort include
Mike Barnett (Univ. of Idaho), Satya Gupta (Intel SSD),
Rik Littlefield (PNL), and Prasenjit Mitra (now with Oracle).

The library implements a comprehensive approach to collective
communication.  The results are best summarized by the following
performance tables 

 Comparison of the various libraries 

The following tables give the ratios of times required
for completion on 
a 16x32 mesh Paragon using OSF R1.3

      1024     1.0        1.0        2.0       
     65536    21.1        4.1        6.9       
   1048576    34.6        5.9       11.8       



Attaining the improvement in performance is as easy as
linking in a library that automatically translates NX collective
communication calls to iCC calls.  Furthermore, the iCC library gives
additional functionality like scatter and gather operations, and more
general "gopf" combine operations.  

As had been planned, an MPI-like group interface to iCC is now 
available.  The interface lets the user create and free groups 
and communicators, and it gives user-defined groups complete 
access to the high performance routines in the iCC library. 

We would like to note that this library is not intended to compete 
with MPI.  It was started as a research project into techniques 
required to develop high performance implementations of the MPI
collective communication calls.  We are making this library available
as a service to the user community, with the hope that these techniques
eventually are incorporated into efficient MPI implementations. 
  Using the library.
