CS304P - Teaching Assistants - Spring 1996



Discussion Sections


Discussion sections meet on Mondays and Wednesdays for one hour each.
Your discussion section will likely end up with less than 40 students,
so it is much easier to be heard here than in lecture.
For maximum benefit, read the assigned material and prepare your questions
before class.
