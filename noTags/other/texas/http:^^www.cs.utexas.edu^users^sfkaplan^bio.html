Information about Scott

Well, I can't say there's a lot of info to put here, but I promise to put some more later.  I'm a student at the The University of Texas at Austin, in the Ph.D. program for Computer Science.

Oh what the heck, here's info on how to reach me:


Scott Kaplan
Taylor Hall 2.124
Austin, TX  78712
Home phone: (512) 419-9727
Work phone: (512) 471-9586
Cell phone: (512) 497-1450

If you'd like to find me in person, your best bet is to check in
Taylor Hall 5.144.  But I don't keep much in the way of regular hours,
so it would just be luck.  (Good or bad, I leave that to you...)

Okay, this is almost a useless page, but there will be more at some point.  If you feel like it, email me.
Go back to Scott's home page.
