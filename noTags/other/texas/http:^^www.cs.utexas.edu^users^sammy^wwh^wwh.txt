  The W3 Consortium provides an veritable well-spring of
information about the web. I downloaded the reference software
(library of code for communicating on the web) and the associated
command-line web interface. I also found an SGML lexer that I didn't
use. At this site, one can find standards documents for all aspects of
the web.
