system by its inventor, Dr. Robert M.  Metcalfe.



 Quick Reference Guides

The entire set of  Quick Reference Guides provides a complete
configuration manual for Ethernet, available for free on the Web!  The
Guides contain over 150 pages of concise technical information,
including more than 60 figures and tables.



The 14 Quick Reference Guides contain the configuration rules for each
Ethernet media type as well as the configuration rules for combining
media types.  This makes it possible for you to verify the
configuration of your Ethernet design to make sure that it will work
properly.
