Ken Harker - Linux Advocacy



Ken Harker - 
Linux



Linux is the operating system of the future.  It is a full-featured, very 
stable, open clone of the UNIXÂ® operating system.  I run Linux on my Texas 
Instruments TravelMate 4000M notebook computer.  My present system is
based on the Red Hat 3.0.3 distribution, and now features the Linux 1.3.100 
kernel, the X Window System in full color, hot-swappable PCMCIA card support, 
10baseT ethernet, a SCSI II bus, full support for 16 bit stereo sound and MIDI,
joystick support, and a 14.4 modem.
To do my part to give back to the Linux community that has given me so much,
I have maintained the 

Linux Laptop Home Page since October 1995, and the 

Linux Laptop Volunteer Support Database since January 1996.  An article
I've written, "Linux on Mobile Computers," was published by the 
Linux Journal in their 
June, 1996 issue.

Below are some of the most useful sources of information about the Linux 
operating system.
