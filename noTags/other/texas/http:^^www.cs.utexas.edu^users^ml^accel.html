The ACCEL Abductive Reasoning System
ACCEL

ACCEL is a general purpose system that uses abductive reasoning to
construct explanations for observed intelligent phenomena.  These
explanations are then used to avoid redundant work in future problem
solving episodes.  We define an abductive explanation as a consistent
set of assumptions which when combined with background knowledge,
logically entails a set of observations. 

ACCEL has been constructed as a domain-independent system, in which
knowledge about a variety of domains has been uniformly encoded as
first-order Horn-clause axioms.  A general-purpose abduction
algorithm, AAA, is used to efficiently construct explanations by
caching partial explanations.  ACCEL has been shown to achieve more
than an order of magnitude speedup in run time for a variety of
domains, including plan recognition in text understanding, and
diagnosis of medical diseases, logic circuits, and dynamic
systems. 


Common Lisp source code for the ACCEL system and several diagnosis
domains is available via  
anonymous FTP .
