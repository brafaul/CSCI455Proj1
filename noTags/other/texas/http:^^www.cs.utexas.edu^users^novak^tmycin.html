TMYCIN Expert System Shell


TMYCIN Expert System Shell


TMYCIN is an expert system shell modeled after the EMYCIN shell that was
developed at Stanford.  It is especially useful for student exercises,
although real expert systems have been written using it.


TMYCIN is written in Common Lisp and is fairly small (11 pages of code).
It should run under any implementation of Common Lisp; it will run
under the student version of Gold Hill Lisp with the addition of the
file  gcaux.lsp .


Two example expert systems are furnished: a very small set of rules for
identifying rocks, and a small set of rules for identifying Texas snakes.
