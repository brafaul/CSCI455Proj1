What is PGP?
This comes from the PGP FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).


PGP is a program that gives your electronic mail something that it
otherwise doesn't have: Privacy. It does this by encrypting your mail so
that nobody but the intended person can read it. When encrypted, the
message looks like a meaningless jumble of random characters. PGP has
proven itself quite capable of resisting even the most sophisticated
forms of analysis aimed at reading the encrypted text.
    
PGP can also be used to apply a digital signature to a message without
encrypting it.  This is normally used in public postings where you don't
want to hide what you are saying, but rather want to allow others to
confirm that the message actually came from you. Once a digital signature
is created, it is impossible for anyone to modify either the message or
the signature without the modification being detected by PGP.
