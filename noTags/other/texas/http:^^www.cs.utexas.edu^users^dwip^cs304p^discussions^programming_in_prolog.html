Programming in Prolog

   Logic programming works by defining a set of facts and rules. Facts are 
simplest form of Prolog predicates. For example, suppose we want to express 
the fact that it is raining. In Prolog, it will be expressed as

 raining.



Whereas in Pascal, we will declare a boolean variable raining, and then 
assign it a value true.

 var ¯

		 raining :  boolean ;

		 

		 raining :=  true ;



Note the use of period (`.') after the statement. Each statement in Prolog must be 
ended by a period. Note all the predicates like raining must start with
small letters. The words starting with capital letters are assumed to be
variables. A rule can be expressed using propositional logic taught in
lecture. For example, the fact that `I'll get wet if it's raining', can
be expressed as

 wet :- raining.



and its equivalent code in Pascal will look like

 if ¯( raining ) then

		wet :=  true ;



The symbol `:-' is read as if. The and and or
operators can also be expressed in Prolog easily. For example,

 miserable :- cold, wet.



means that `I'll be miserable if it's cold and if I get wet'. The
symbol `,' is read as and. Similarly,

 miserable :- cold.

miserable :- wet.



expresses the fact that 'I'll be miserable if it's cold or if I get wet'.

1)
 Write prolog statements for the following


 I am mortal. A metal is gold if it is yellow and heavy. I will pass the course if I do well in the finals.



   Comments can we written in Prolog by putting a percent sign (%) at the 
beginning of a line.

 % This is an example program

% It illustrates how to put comments

wet :- raining.

miserable :- cold.

miserable :- wet.
