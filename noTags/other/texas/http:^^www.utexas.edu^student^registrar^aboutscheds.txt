Course Schedules





The Course Schedule is published three times a year, just before advising and registration begin for each semester and summer session. It lists the courses to be offered each semester, including the time, location, and instructor for each course, if this 

information is available at the time of publication. It also gives the unique number for each course, which students must know in order to register, and other essential registration information and instructions.

Follow the link at the end of the page for information on ordering a printed Course Schedule. The Course Schedule is also published in the following electronic versions:






The web Course Schedule for Spring 1997 contains the same information as the printed Course Schedule and is not updated after publication. 
Back issues of the Course Schedule available on the web are:
Fall 1996, 
Summer 1996, and  
Spring 1996. 
Some earlier Course Schedules are available on Gopher.
 utACCESS Course Schedule
contains the information about courses that is in the printed and electronic Course Schedules and also information about class availability. The utACCESS Course Schedule is updated immediately as changes are made to the semester's course offerings. It remains

 available at least through the twelfth class day of the semester. To view the utACCESS Course Schedule, you must have the application tn3270. To download this application, follow the link at the beginning of this paragraph to go to the utACCESS home page.

Printed Course Schedules are sold in Austin at most campus-area bookstores. For instructions on ordering a printed copy by mail, follow this link:
