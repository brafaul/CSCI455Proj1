Model Rocketry






My Estes Yellowjacket rising up 
      above Zilker Park in Austin, TX, USA


I've entered the hobby of model rocketry as a new and occasional 
      artistic diversion in my life.  I'm presently looking for new and better 
      launch sites around Austin, TX.
      
Below are some links to data and photographs about my rockets, as 
      well as some links to other online rocketry resources.
