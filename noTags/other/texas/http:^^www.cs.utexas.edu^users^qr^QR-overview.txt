Qualitative Reasoning about the Physical World




Qualitative Reasoning about the Physical World
A short abstract describes our approach
to qualitative and semi-quantitative reasoning about the physical world.

The indexed bibliography of our
research papers is the best way to understand the areas we work in, to
find out what papers are available, and to retrieve them via the Web. 

The QSIM Users page gives an overview
of other published work building on ours.
