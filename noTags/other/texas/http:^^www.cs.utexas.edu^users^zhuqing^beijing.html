Beijing



Beijing -- my home town



Beijing is the 
capital of China, the political, culture, and education center of China. 
If you have not visited Beijing yet, you'd better consider
a trip to 
Beijing. Don't hesitate! Mr. Graham Hawker will tell you what happened in 
his tour in Beijing.
You can look around 
the scenery of Beijing and 
you will love Beijing
too . Before the trip you may read the 
 Trave Assist File first.
