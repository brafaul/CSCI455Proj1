Research ( 2-Feb-1996)




Research

I helped design and develop a lisp-based statistical package called Clasp,
as part of the Clip/Clasp
project. The goal of this work is to provide support of empirical AI
research.

I am currently working on an extension of the Buridan and C-Buridan planners.  These
planners are based on decision theory and incorporate a probabilistic view of
planning and plan execution.
