CSE 567 Syllabus


CSE 567: Principles of Digital Systems Design 
Carl Ebeling, Fall 1996 

Syllabus

The goal of this course to give an overall understanding of how
computation is implemented in hardware.  The class starts with the
basics of implementing functional (combinational) and sequential
computations.  It builds on this to discuss methodologies for
designing and implementing large systems comprising many components.
Standard system components like memories, datapath elements and busses
are described and models for combining them to perform both general
and special-purpose computation are covered.  Topics also include
system specification using a hardware description language and
synthesis and optimization of combinational and sequential circuits.
