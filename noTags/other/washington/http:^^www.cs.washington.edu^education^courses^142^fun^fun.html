CSE/ENGR 142: Fun and Games


CSE/ENGR 142: Not Computer Programming I

You can definitely expect this page to change as we bump into other
interesting stuff.  Enjoy!  (No, we won't have too much of this stuff on
the final...)


This is a great link to a bunch of other links:

The Whole Internet Catalog.
Also of interest is the collection of wonderful - to - wacky
(Check out the Strawberry Pop-Tart Blowtorch page!)
web links collected by our own department chair 
Ed Lazowska.
The  Official University of Washington 
homepage is a great place to check out the view of Mount Rainier that you
are missing.

The Arts

    check what's playing.  Click

 Have not had time to go to a Museum lately?  Well, if you are
    going to see any why not go to a really good one, like 
    
 The Louvre.

The Gastronomic Arts

No more HUB food?  Here is a
    Seattle restaurant
    guide.
 This is not a link but a hint.  If you were looking for a nice
    place to have coffee on the UW campus, where would you go?  Your TAs
    have been known to occasionally visit the Burke Museum Cafe which is
    on the Burke Museum (near the corner of 15th and 45th), and the
    coffee-shop in the basement of the Art Department (one of the two
    buildings on the north end of the Quad).  Now if you wanted other
    places to have coffee you could look at 
    a guide
    to Seattle coffee which strangely enough is edited in
    Philadelphia...

Megadeth to Mahler, Beethoven to Old Blue Eyes, accordions to xylophones,

Science

 You heard about the comet fragments hitting Jupiter?  Well, now you
    can see
    some pretty cool images...  When these were brand new, so many people
    were downloading them that the internet slowed to a crawl.

   Bizarre, but true..I never had to dissect a frog in school and I
    don't miss the experience.  But if you are a biology aficionado you may
    want to follow
