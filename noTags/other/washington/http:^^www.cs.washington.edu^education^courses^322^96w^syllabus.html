 Homework

Homework is due every Friday at the beginning of class.  Please leave on the 
table near the door.  Late homeworks are not accepted unless you make a
request before it is due.

A normal homework will consist of a combination of problems from the book and my
own problems.  Generally, problems from the book will give you a chance to 
practice some of the derivations and constructions used in the theory of
computation.  Generally, my problems will be more challenging and may require 
developing proofs.
