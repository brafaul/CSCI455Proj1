       UW Band Program 
 Since I play clarinet in the Wind Ensemble at UW, I maintain
       web pages for the band program at the University of Washington.

  
 

       Seattle Concert Calendar 
 A listing of upcoming concerts in the Seattle area. (Be
       warned, it's hasn't been updated for a while.)

 

       Goldberg 
 A vaporware musical composition assistant that I helped design
       for a user interface course.  I would love to build a tool like
       this one, but haven't had the time yet.

  
 

       Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 
 An old page of links to images and sites relating to
       the impact of this comet with Jupiter.
