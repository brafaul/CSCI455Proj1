 Marc's Camping Checklists 




 Marc's Camping Checklists 

Going camping?  Can't remember every last little item?  It's no
problem with these checklists!


  Backcountry camping 
  Car camping 
  Bike camping 


These lists roughly reflect what I bring when I go camping.  They are
not intended to be definitive.  They do not include technical
equipment that you would need when telemarking, snowshoeing, or
climbing.

Always go camping with someone who knows what they're
doing.  Knowing what to bring is not a substitute for knowing what
you're doing.
