Technology, pages 129-136.



Abstract

Inequality constraints are useful for specifying various aspects of user
interfaces, such as constraints that one window is to the left of another,
or that an object is contained within a rectangle.  However, current local
propagation constraint solvers can't handle inequality constraints.  We
present Indigo, an efficient local propagation algorithm for satisfying
acyclic constraint hierarchies, including inequality constraints.
