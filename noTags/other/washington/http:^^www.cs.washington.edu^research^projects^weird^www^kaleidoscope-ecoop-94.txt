Abstract

Constraint imperative programming is an integration of declarative constraints
and imperative object-oriented programming.  The primary goal of this
integration is to use constraints to express relations among objects
explicitly -- relations that were implicit in the code in previous languages.
However, one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming,
object identity, can result in implicit relations, even when explicit identity
constraints are supported.  We analyze the problem and propose a solution --
identity constraints -- which we have implemented in our Kaleidoscope'93
language.  This solution is understandable, efficiently implementable, and
compatible with the Kaleidoscope constraint model.
