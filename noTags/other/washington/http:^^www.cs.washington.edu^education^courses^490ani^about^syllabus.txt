Projects and due dates:
The first five projects are due a week after they are assigned.  Projects
will be critiqued in class on the due date, so late projects are not
acceptable.  After a critique session, you will have one week to implement
the suggestions given in class.

A class project will occupy the last five weeks of class.  This will consist
of several mini-deadlines and one final due date on the last day of
class.  The only way this project will be completed is if all deadlines are
met.
