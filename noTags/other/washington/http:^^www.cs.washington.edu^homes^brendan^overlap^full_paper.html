Abstract:
This paper addresses a computational biology problem which
is to decide whether two clones (segments of a genome)
overlap based on their  multiple complete digest (MCD) fingerprint.
The problem arises in the context of building a physical map
of a genome, an important step in the human genome project.
The main result is an overlap test which is
argued to be powerful in a stochastic model of the process
in the sense of admitting the lowest false negative rate for a given rate
of false positives.  Initial experiments show that it yields about
20% fewer false negatives for a given rate of false positives than
a commonly used test.  This is likely to improve the success of
the subsequent mapping stages.
