Web Gothic Image



 
	Web Gothic


	by Adam Finkelstein 








This is an adaptation of the oil painting  American Gothic 
(1930) by Grant Wood.  I made it by collecting a bunch of images off
the Web, shrinking them down to little tiny squares, and arranging
them to suggest the underlying image.  Furthermore I changed their
grayscale values to adapt to the grayscale values of the underlying
image.
