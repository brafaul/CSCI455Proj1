 Benchmarks
 Debugging
 Implementation techniques
	-- techniques for implementing both
	conventional and novel programming languages.
 Instruction-level parallelism
	-- compiler techniques for exploiting ILP
 Interpreters and simulators
	-- implemented using compilers and compiler techniques.
 Language design
 Multiple processors
	-- compiling for machines with multiple processors,
	both shared-memory multiprocessors and distributed-memory
	multicomputers.
 Profiling and tracing
	-- use compiler techniques to improve profiling and tracing,
	use profiles to improve compilation.
 Register allocation
 Runtime code generation
	-- introducing new code into a running program.
 Synchronization
	-- how it behaves and how to implement it.
 Threads and multithreading
	runtime systems for multithreading.
