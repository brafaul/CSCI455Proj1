The UCPOP planner




The UCPOP Planner

Version 4.0 of UCPOP now available!


Common Lisp source code for the UCPOP partial order planner, version 4.0,
is now available via anonymous FTP.
UCPOP operates with actions that have
conditional effects and universally quantified preconditions and effects.  It 
accepts universally quantified goals.  In addition, UCPOP 4.0 allows domain
axioms and predicates that call Common Lisp code to determine
satisfiability.  With a conservative search strategy UCPOP is both sound
and complete for this representation, but one can add aggressive,
domain-dependent search control with convenient declarative rules. Our
Common Lisp implementation is simple enough for classroom use, yet quite
efficient (requiring between 2-20ms to explore and refine a partial plan).


Version 4.0 replaces and subsumes version 2.0.  Highlights include:


 Twice as fast at plan elaboration
 The revamped, improved graphical Plan DeBugger (
here).
 Improved quantification over dynamic universes
 More sophisticated search control strategies (including Schubert and
Gerevini's ZLIFO)
 Improved user's manual



This builds on the features introduced in version 2.0:


 Declarative specification of search control rules 
 Universal quantification over dynamic universes (object creation and
       destruction) 
 Domain axioms
 Predicates expanding to lisp code
 Larger set of domain theories & search functions for testing.

 This work was first presented at KR-92:
 
    Penberthy, J. S. and Weld, D., ``UCPOP: A Sound, Complete, Partial-Order
    Planner for ADL,'' Third International Conference on Knowledge
    Representation and Reasoning (KR-92), Cambridge, MA, October 1992.  


An experimental implementation of UCPOP 2.0 in C++ is also available.  
It is about an order of magnitude faster than the Lisp implementation 
but it doesn't have all the extensions.  Please send us 
mail 
for more information.
