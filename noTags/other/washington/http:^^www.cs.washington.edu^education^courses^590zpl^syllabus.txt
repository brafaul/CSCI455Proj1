CSE 590 ZP: Course Syllabus



 
 


CSE 590 ZP: Course Syllabus






The last four weeks of the quarter will be devoted to presentations by
class participants.  They will describe the scientific computation
that they are working on -- ideally, this discussion focuses on a
terrific ZPL solution, but more realistically, it will focus on the
problem and how to progress towards a solution.



We will reschedule the 11/27 class due.  Stay tuned for more details.
