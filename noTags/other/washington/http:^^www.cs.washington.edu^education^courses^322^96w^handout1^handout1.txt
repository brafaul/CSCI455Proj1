Construction of Regular Grammars from Regular Expressions



For the purposes of this construction we use regular grammars
which have productions of the form  and 
.
To generate the the empty language no productions are needed.
To generate the singleton language  just use the two
productions  and .

For the recursive part of the construction,
let  and
 be regular
grammars which generate the languages defined by the regular
expression  and , respectively.  We will assume
that .  Given the regular 
expression  which is built from the regular expressions
 and  we define a new regular grammar 
 which
generates the language defined by .
There are three cases to consider:

Case 1.  .  Let  be a new
non-terminal. 
  is the start symbol of .

.


Case 2.  .

 and
.


Case 3.  . Let  be a new
non-terminal. 
  is the start symbol for .
