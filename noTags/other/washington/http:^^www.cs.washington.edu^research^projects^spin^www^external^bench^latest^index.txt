SPIN Benchmarks


SPIN Benchmarks (under contruction) 
This page is devoted to measurements of operating system performance
for SPIN and other operating systems.  This page will be constantly 
evolving as new measurements are made and new benchmarks are added.
Under each clickable benchmark item you should find an explanation of
the test, the source code for the benchmark for each system (still not ready, sorry -Stefan), and possibly some discussion about the significance of
the results.  Some pages have not yet been completed, please bear with us.

Note: This page uses the table extension and may not be viewable
