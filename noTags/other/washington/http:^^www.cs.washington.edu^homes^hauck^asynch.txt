Asynchronous Circuits

 Asynchronous Circuits


Asynchronous design has been an active area of research since at least the
mid 1950's, but has yet to achieve widespread use.  In

"Asynchronous Design Methodologies:  An Overview"
we examine the benefits and problems inherent in asynchronous computations,
and in some of the more notable design methodologies.
These include Huffman asynchronous circuits, burst-mode circuits,
Micropipelines, template-based and Trace Theory-based delay-insensitive
circuits, Signal Transition Graphs, Change Diagrams, and compilation-based
quasi-delay-insensitive circuits.

This paper is meant to be readable by someone with some experience with logic
design, but not necessarily any exposure to asynchronous circuits.  It may
also serve as a good overview of the field for someone with a strong knowledge
of specific asynchronous methodology(ies).

Also relevant to asynchronous circuits is Montage, the first FPGA for
asynchronous circuits.  
The paper 
"An FPGA For Implementing Asynchronous Circuits",
gives a good overview of the architecture and software tools, though the hypertext page
Triptych/Montage FPGA Architectures
will give a quick taste.
