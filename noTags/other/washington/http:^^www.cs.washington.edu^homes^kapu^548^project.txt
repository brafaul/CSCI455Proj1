Evaluating predicated and speculative execution on Alpha




Evaluating predicated and speculative execution on Alpha

  Project idea 

 Predicated execution combines the effects of performing a test and
branching based on the test. Hence a branch is avoided, which
increases the pipeline efficiency and eases the scheduling for
superscalar execution. Speculative execution, i.e., prediction of the
branch direction, will facilitate speculative execution since the
program contains less branches. The exact nature of their interaction,
however, is not clear at the surface. Will they have their own niches,
e.g., is predicated execution mainly useful for small branches and
speculative for large branches?  Will their efforts overlap so that
the combined speedup of the parts is less than their sum, or maybe
they are orthogonal (combination equals sum) or there is synergy
(combination exceeds sum)?

In the project we ended up concentrating more on the conditional
moves rather than speculative execution. Here's our 
report .

Here's the  data  we gathered.
