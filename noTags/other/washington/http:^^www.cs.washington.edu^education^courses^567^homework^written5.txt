CSE567 Homework Assignment #5



CSE 567: Principles of Digital Systems Design 
Carl Ebeling, Fall 1996 

Homework 5
Distributed: Wednesday. Nov. 6 Due Friday Nov. 15, in class

You are to work together as teams on this homework. Please look at the
problems individually first and sketch possible solutions and questions.
Then meet together and formulate solutions to each if you can, and assign
the writeup to one or more team members. Then meet again to collate and
review your solutions before you hand them in. The whole team is responsible
for understanding the solution to all problems. 
 For problems involving Verilog code, hand in your code and your simulation
log (or at least part of it if it's really long). 

 
Design two modules, one to do run-length encoding on an input stream
of bytes and another to do the corresponding run-length decoding. By plugging
your two modules back-to-back, you should reconstruct the original byte-stream.
You must design your own protocol for this - there are optimizations you
can try based on the image compression context. One of the things you must
worry about is the fact that the compressed stream is not the same length
as as the original stream. Although it's generally shorter, it might be
longer depending on your run-length coding. Your circuits must handle any
possibility of course.

Design your circuits using Verilog and use the simulator to show that it
works.

Design a circuit that performs a one-level 2D wavelet transform on
a 16x16 image. The image and the resulting transform are stored in two
different memory modules. You should store the sub-images you produce as four
8x8 images in the 16x16 output image.

The memories you should use are simple static RAMs with an 8-bit address,
an 8-bit data input for writes, an 8-bit data output for reads and a single
R/W control signal which is asserted high when reading and asserted low
for writing. You should write a Verilog model for this memory. Note that
it has no clock input. If R/W is asserted (read) then the data output should
be what the address selects. (If the address changes, so does the data
out.) If R/W is unasserted (write), then nothing happens until R/W changes
to high again, at which time the data on the input is written into the
memory.


 In this problem, you will design and test a simple cache controller
using Verilog simulation. This cache is a direct-mapped, read-allocate,
write-through cache. The controller sits between the processor and the
cache memory and generates the control signals needed by the processor
and the memory. The cache controller has the following I/O signals:

Inputs: 

 
 Read - Processor asserts to request a read. 
 Write - Processor asserts to request a write. (Only one of Read/Write
can be asserted at once) 
 Address - Processor provides the memory address of word being read
or written.
Hit - The cache tag memory asserts Hit if the memory address is in
the cache.
Reset - Resets the cache controller into an initial state. 

Outputs: 

Ready - Signal to the processor indicating data is present and processor
can continue. 
MemRead - Asserted to tell memory to perform a read operation
MemWrite - Asserted to tell memory to perform a write operation. Only
one of MemRead and MemWrite can be asserted at a time. 
MemAddress - Address to main memory of word being read/written. 

Addresses are word addresses with 4 words per cache line. On each cycle,
the processor asserts a read or write request (or neither) to the cache controller
along with the memory address of a word. It then waits for the Ready signal
to be asserted. A cache tag module checks to see if the address is in the
cache. If so, it asserts Hit in the next cycle after the Read/Write request
is asserted. (You do not have to design the cache tag module - assume it's
there and the Hit signal is asserted appropriately.) Different things happen
depending on whether a Read or Write has been asserted:

Read - If Hit is asserted, then Ready should be asserted immediately
(same clock cycle as Hit). If Hit is not asserted, the controller must
read the cache line from memory, starting with the requested word. From
the time MemRead is asserted, it takes 4 cycles before the first word from
memory is available. After that, it takes only one cycle per word read
from the same cache line. That is, the controller issues MemRead with the
address of the first word to be accessed, waits 4 cycles and then issues
3 more reads, one per cycle with the addresses of the remaining words in
the cache line. The controller can assert the Ready signal as soon as the
data from the requested address is available.

Write - Writes are easier since cache lines are not allocated on a
write miss. Whether or not Hit is asserted, the controller issues a write
to memory for one word. Ready can be asserted immediately, however, without
waiting for the write to complete, which takes 4 cycles.

Read/Write Overlap - Reads and writes that go to memory cannot overlap.
That is, if there are two read misses in a row, the second set of reads
to memory must wait until the previous reads have completed. This can happen
because the controller asserts Ready before completing all the reads from
the first miss. If a read miss or a write is followed by a read hit, however,
Ready can be asserted right away since no memory access is required. 

Write a Verilog description for this cache controller and use Verilog-XL
to test your design. We will provide a driver for your design in a couple
days. 
