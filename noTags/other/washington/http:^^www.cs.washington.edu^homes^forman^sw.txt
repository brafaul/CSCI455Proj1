George Forman: Free Software (Scripts)


 AWK and PERL are great inventions.  Here's a handful of scripts I've
found really helpful in my work.  Hope they can be of use to others.


	"A little script can go a long way."

 For numerical data:


graphcols **
	graphs multiple columns of data using gnuplot, 
	then lets you drive interactively

stats
	computes: min, max, sum, average, standard deviation, coefficient of
	variation, and count

colstats **
	ditto, for each column of data

median
	finds the middlemost of a set of numbers

medians
	ditto, for each column of data

histogram
	computes a histogram (discrete or continuous, percentages or total
	counts, pdf or cdf); view by piping to 'xgraph' or 'graphcols 1:2'

linear.regression
	computes slope, y-intercept, and correlation coefficient

 Others:


timeclocks **
	a Tcl/Tk script to help you track your time spent throughout the day
	on various projects/categories, e.g., writing code vs. reading news
	vs. errands

recol
	re-formats columns of a table: width of each column determined by max
	width item of whole input

transpose
	transpose rows <--> columns

dobykey
	runs your UNIX command on input lines batched by 'key' column
	on each line; helps for things like "disk usage by user"


	"Reuse, recycle, redistribute freely."
