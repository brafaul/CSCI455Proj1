 Effective Removal of Detail for a Multiresolution Viewer 


 Fast Rendering of Subdivision Surfaces 

 Here are the slides that I presented for a Technical Sketch at
SIGGRAPH '96.  I have also added to each page a narrative I prepared
for the talk.


  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

These pages were created with Webify.
Webify is a program which makes web-browsable trees of hypertext
files and JPEG images from Postscript source files.  It was motivated
by the need to convert Powerpoint presentations to humane web form,
such as the following simple example:


Resolution and other parameters are adjustable, allowing most any
postscript file (papers, manuals, books) to be automatically converted
to page-browsable form.


Webify is freely distributed in C source form, and runs on UNIX
systems having Ghostscript installed with PPM conversion along with
the cjpeg utility (both available free).  It
can be used (on UNIX systems) to convert postscript files generated
on Macs, PCs, and elsewhere.

a large compressed tar file containing webify source.  The size of
the file stems from the postscript containing the above
presentation; webify is a simple, single C program which
invokes GhostScript to do most of the real work.  Documentation
is sparse.
