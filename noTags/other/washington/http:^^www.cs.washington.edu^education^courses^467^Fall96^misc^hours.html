CSE467 Staff Hours


CSE467: Advanced Logic Design
Carl Ebeling, Spring 1996 

Office Hours
There will always be someone in the Lab during the lab sections
Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.  In addition, we will hold regular
hours as shown in the chart below.  I will consult from my office,
Sieg 215, and the TAs will consult in the 327 lab.

Stephen Lee has an office in the laboratory (327 Sieg).  You should see him
if you need any components, have a problem with some of the equipment, or
want to check out a manual.  Although he is usually in his office during
regular business hours, he has to deal with 3 courses using the laboratory
this quarter.  Therefore, you should try to talk to him during our priority
laboratory hours of Tuesday 1:30-4:20 and Thursday 1:30-4:20. You can
also reach him via e-mail (slee@cs).
