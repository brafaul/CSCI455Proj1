UW Constraint-Based Languages and Systems


UW Constraint-Based Languages and Systems

Welcome to the home page for Constraints at 
UW CSE.

  

A constraint is a relation that should be satisfied; for example, that a line
remain horizontal, that a resistor in an electrical circuit simulation
obey Ohm's Law, or that the height of a bar in a bar chart be proportional
to some number in an application program.  Constraints have been used in a
variety of languages and systems, particularly user interface toolkits,
in planning and scheduling, and in simulation.



Our research is in several areas: 

constraint imperative programming, in particular the 
   Kaleidoscope language
constraint logic programming, in particular the HCLP language scheme
constraint hierarchies
constraint solvers
using constraints in user interface construction

Funding

This research is currently supported in part by two grants from the 
National Science Foundation:
"Constraint-Based Languages and Environments for Building Interactive
Systems", Grant No. IRI-9302249, Interactive Systems Program, and
"Constraint Imperative Programming", Grant No. CCR-9402551, Programming
Languages and Compilers Program.  The work on constraint satisfaction

Other Resources

We also maintain an 
anonymous ftp directory at UW on
//ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/constraints.  The 
 code
subdirectory contains source code for various constraint solvers and
systems, including DeltaBlue and SkyBlue.  All this code is public domain.
The 
ppcp94 subdirectory contains papers from the 1994 Principles and
Practice of Constraint Programming Workshop.  There is a

papers subdirectory with research papers (but all of the
papers are also listed in this WWW document, so don't bother).
Finally, there is a 

drafts subdirectory, which sometimes contains preliminary drafts of
papers.
