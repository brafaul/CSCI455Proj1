Research Work

I am working on the Chinook  project, which is a CAD tool for embedded systems.
I have worked on

 synthesis of glue logic and driver routine customization
	  for microcontrollers with (parallel) I/O ports.
	This is joint work with Ross Ortega and Gaetano (my advisor).
   
 The official publication is in
	  
	   ICCAD-92 .  This was implemented and demo'ed at DAC
	   in San Diego, CA in June 1994.
      We added memory-mapped I/O and presented it at
	
	the 1st workshop on HW/SW Co-Design 
	in Estes Park, CO in September 1992.  This paper was submitted
	as a proposal but not published in the proceedings.
   
 static scheduling techniques for meeting timing constraints
	   in software.
   
 The overview is described in
	   
	   IEEE Micro.  This is co-authored with Elizabeth Walkup and
	   Gaetano.
      The algorithm in
	   
	   DAC-94 handles fixed delay values and mode transitions.
      The paper submitted to
	   
	   DAC-95
	   handles delay ranges, not just worst case delays.
	   It includes heuristics for finding short feasible schedules.
   


In progress:

 advanced interface synthesis using memory mapping and
		bandwidth transformation.
	 code generation and timing estimation
	 putting everything together into a program people can really
		use.
