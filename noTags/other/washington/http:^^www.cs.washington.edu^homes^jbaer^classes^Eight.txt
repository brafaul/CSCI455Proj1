 Eight Puzzle Applet 


8-Puzzle
(Java baby steps)



Sorry, you are not using a Java compatible browser


Click on a tile next to the blank space to move it.


History:


2/3/96 -- Added custom update method to make redrawing of the puzzle
iteself happen offscreen to get rid of occasional flicker.


2/2/96 -- The randomize button now works, and the Repeat Last button
currently puts the puzzle back in order.  That will change.


1/29/96 -- Note that although buttons now appear for the
aforementioned functions, they don't actually do anything yet.  Oh
well, at least I figured out Layouts.


1/25/96 -- First put up.  Much more is coming, including a randomize
button an a couple of AI search algorithms to automatically solve the puzzle.


Pretty badly documented source for
what's here so far
