Projects

Here is a sample of the projects I worked on or I am currently working on:

The Homepage-Finder
Shortly after my arrival at the University of Washington I joined Jonathan
Shakes in his Homepage-Finder project. He is trying to set up a web-service
that let's the user easily find homepages on the world wide web. Check out
the current progress at

HighTension Therapy module
In my 3rd and 4th year at the University of Bielefeld I worked in the
HighTension project, in order to build a rule-based therapy module for an
ongoing research project (the 

HYPERCON- system). The implementation language was CommonLISP, and we
used the Knowledge Shell Knowledge Craft from Carnegie Group.
University of Bielefeld Library Web Server
In 1995 I set up the first Web Server in the University Library, including
the hardware and software/OS selection, installation and maintainance, and
the creation of the library web HTML pages. Although it is now maintained 
by a large group of people from various departments, you still might find 
me on the editorial page:
