Entry Consistency on the T3D
Kari Pulli & Peter Van Vleet

 Abstract
This paper presents several strategies for the implementation of an
entry consistent, distributed shared memory model on the Cray T3D. The
Cray T3D supports a very fast interconnect and  
allows direct remote memory accesses. We found that with such fast
communication, many optimizations useful in the typical distributed
environment (a relatively slow interconnect) are counter
productive compared to a simple and straightforward implementation.
