Prove that  for all n > 0. (#27 p. 27)

We can prove this by induction on n:

Basis: The statement is true for n = 1 because
.

Inductive hypothesis: Assume that the statement is true for n=k:

Inductive step: From this we need to show it is true for n=k+1:

By induction, the statement is true for all .

 Using the tree on p. 27:(#27 p. 27)
 The depth of the tree is 4.  (The depth of the root is 0.)
 The ancestors of  are ,,, and .
(Every node is an ancestor of itself.)
 The minimal common ancestor of  and  is  and
of  and  is .
 The subtree generated by  is the following:

 The frontier of the tree is .



The rank of  in the enumeration ordering of  is 

This is because if we look at the strings of length 2n, the first strings
in the enumeration are those that begin with .  
Of the strings that begin with ,  is the first
and  is the last of these.  This gives us the following:

The rank of  is .
The number of strings  of length 2n that begin with  is just
the number of ways of writing the last n letters as a string in the alphabet.
There are  such ending strings.  Combining these observations gives us:



The rank of  in the enumeration ordering of  is

In the enumeration ordering, the strings that come before  are exactly
the strings over  whose length is less than n.  Therefore,

For any i, the number of strings of length i is .  
Thus the number of strings of length less than n is the sum of all these,
so:
