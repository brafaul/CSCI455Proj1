Answers and Hints to Review Sheet


1. The trend is that R+M machine tends to have more percentage of
branch instructions while L/S machines tend to have the lowest percentage
of branch instructions. The reason is that for every computation task there
exists a fixed number of branches but the encoding for different kinds of
machines differs. Because R+M has the most compact encoding, it has the
highest percentage of branches. 
2. L/S machine:

LD.W R1, B
LD.W R2, C
ADD.2 R3, R2, R1
ST.W A, R3
(4 words)

R/M machine:

LD.W R1, B
ADD.2 R1, C
ST.W A, R1
(3 words)

R+M machin:

ADD.W A, B, C
( 2 words)


3. Page 151, we get 6.9 instructions gain using the perfect register
window. So in all, the total execution speed up is 110.9/104 - 1 = 6.6%

4. system call/return: 84*1.5/12 = 10.5
trap/interrupt: 103*1.5 / 14 = 11.0
page table entry change: 36*1.5 / 11 = 4.0
context switch: 135 * 1.5 / 9 = 22.5

5. Basically, instruction run-length is the number of instructions
between branches. 
One would expect L/S machines to have a larger run-length simply it
has the lowest percentage of branch intructions. (refer to Question 1)

6. BC, BR, BCR, BRR 0.524 * (0.2 + 0.432)
+ loop control 0.071 * 0.91
+ procedure call 0.405
-----------------------
total = 0.8

7. The centered branch table contains 
both prefetched instructions and retained preciously
executed instructions. 
64 words (256 bytes) would be needed for an L/S architecture
to be at least 50% effective. (refer to figure 3.12)

8. 58.557% of instructions in a program depends for their execution
on data values computed in the previous three instructions. 
0.586 * 0. 53 = 0.31 cycles.

9. IF/IF/D/EX/MEM/MEM/WB

10. ADD: IF/IF/D/EX /MEM/MEM/WB
BC: BLANK/IF/IF/D/EX/MEM/MEM/WB
TARGET: BLANK/BLANK/IF/IF/BLANK/TIF/TIF/D
INLINE: BLANK/BLANK/IF/IF/BLANK/D

11. ADD: IF/IF/D/EX/MEM/MEM/WB
ADD: BLANK/IF/IF/D/BLANK/BLANK/EX/MEM/MEM/WB

12. for question 10, we have 1.5 cycles delay( 1 or 2) and for question
11, we have 2 cycles delay.

13. The previous AG instruction is waiting for the result of the
former instruction.
The AG is controlled by the output of the decocde, so a new decode can't
be stored until AG is finished. 

14. Because compilers could make use of it to reorganize the instructions
so that decoding pipeline delay can be reduced and free instructinons could be 
executed. 

15.  A Run-on instruction is basically an instruction that occupies 
the execution unit for many cycles than for basic instructions.
 
e.g., multiply   or divide  unit.
