Tools

vp
vp is the Verilog parser.  It takes a Verilog
	    file and splits it into two parts.
     The structural description is extracted and passed
	    to the port allocator.
     The behavioral description,
	    which contains concurrent, time-driven and event-driven
	    code, is translated into C and output to a compiler.
ap
ap is the I/O port allocator.  The structural output
	 of vp (.env and .bun files)
	 specifies which microcontroller
	 to use and the devices that need to be connected to it. 
     It reads the definition of the devices from the device
	 library and the controller library.
	 (In the diagram they are shown as .dev and
	 .proc files, but we actually use .lib for both).
     After I/O port allocation, it generates two things:
	
 device driver routines in the .h file
	 schematic file in the .sch file.
	
 We have post-processing tools to convert the schematic
       file to other formats.
dd
dd is the pre-allocation device-driver synthesizer.
     It is an optional phase, which converts a timing diagram
       file (.td, in TimingDesigner format) into a SEQ
       that we normally expect in the device library.



The input to the Chinook co-synthesis system consists of the following:
