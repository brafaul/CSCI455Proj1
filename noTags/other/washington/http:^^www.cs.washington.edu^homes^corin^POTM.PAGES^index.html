The POTM Page

Programmer Of The Month - what it be and why it are ...
Once every couple of months, 
The POTM-Master
poses some kind of problem that can be solved with a program of some sort.
(We currently support C, C++, PERL, JAVA, and UNIX shells/tools 
of various sorts.)

Folks from all around the world mail in their source code and their results
are compared.  After breaking all the ties, a winner is declared and they get
custody of the famous rotating POTM trophy until the next contest.

It is for FUN ... nothing more, nothing less.  It started as a contest for
AT&T folks, and (since 1993) 
has grown to a global community of a little under 1000
people from various companies and universities.
Anyone who can get email to me can participate!!!  Get on 
the mailing list
