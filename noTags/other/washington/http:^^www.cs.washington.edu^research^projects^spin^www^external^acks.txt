Friends of SPIN



We've gotten an incredible amount of help from individuals and organizations.
This list is by no means exhaustive.

 ARPA
 A lot of our funding comes from ARPA.

Digital Equipment Corporation  Systems Research Center
 Equipment, our Modula-3 compiler, some of our device drivers, and 
our networking debugging protocol all come from DEC.   Most of this comes
through the generous efforts of Dave Redell at DEC SRC.

 Digital Equipment Corporation, Nashua
 Our DEC UNIX server and pieces of our Alpha-based Mach 3.0 kernel come
from work done by DEC and OSF.  Special thanks to Bob Picco at DEC for
his assistance here.

Open Software Foundation Research Institute
 Many pieces of our OSF/1 Unix server and our Alpha version of
Mach 3.0 come here or the sister institute in Grenoble.

 CMU
 We've borrowed 
pieces of our UNIX server, and some of our
device infrastructure from the CMU Mach project.
Some of us used to work at CMU also.


 IBM
 IBM provides funding for some of us. In addition, IBM recently made
a sizable hardware donation to our
department.

 Intel
 Intel has provided us with lots of equipment that we've used in this
project in one way or another.
