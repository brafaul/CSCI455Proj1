 The Cecil standard library includes a collection of data structures and control structures upon which Cecil programs are constructed. These data and control structures include things that would be built-in to other languages, like integers and for loops, and consequently some understanding of the basic data structures is important for writing any Cecil program. But unlike other languages with built-in structures, in Cecil it's easy to add new operations to standard data types and to define new kinds of control structures that are just as easy to use as the "standard" ones.
