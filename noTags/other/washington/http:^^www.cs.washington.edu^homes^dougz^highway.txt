The Information Super-Hypeway


Everywhere you turn, every newscast, newspaper, magazine, and radio
show is saturated with it... The Databahn.  The Convergence.  The
I-Way.  They all act as if they've stumbled into the Secret of the
Universe.  Digitilliterates who wouldn't know an RJ-11 from a
7-11 suddenly babble on about webs and nets as if those were the
One True Path.  Just look at the sappy road images they trot out.
Enough to make a country-and-western singer puke.  Everything is
"an on-ramp to the information highway."  "A detour."  "A rest stop."
"A tollbooth."  "A dead-end."  "A rut."  "A fast lane."
"A U-turn."  They've turned it into the Information SUPER HYPEWAY.

PC Computing, June 1994
