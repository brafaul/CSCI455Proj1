EDUCATION






PhD Program - CS&E, University
of Washington, Seattle.




MS, 1988 - EECS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.




BS, 1986 - EECS, University of California, Berkeley.



INTEREST






Operating Systems, Distributed and Parallel Systems,
Networking, and Security.



RESEARCH EXPERIENCE






Distributed and Parallel Systems








Using Runtime Measurements in
Parallel Processor Scheduling: Used runtime measurement of
application efficiency to perform dynamic processor scheduling.







In the single-user case, we showed how to use runtime measurements to
determine the number of processors that give the best speedup.




In the
multi-programmed case, we showed how to use runtime measurements to
improve system performance both interactive and batch environments.







Orphan Detection: Implemented an optimization to the Argus (a
distributed transaction-based programming system) orphan detection
algorithm and measured its performance.








Networking








User-level Protocol
Implementation: Demonstrated the feasibility of implementing
communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP) as user-linkable libraries
instead of in the kernel or as a part of a monolithic system server.




Multi-Computer Routing:
Compared performance of adaptive, minimal adaptive, and oblivious
routing.






INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE






SUN Microsystems Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, Summer 1992
& 1994 -- Intern.
Extended the naming server in the Spring distributed systems to support
the storage of persistent objects.






AT&T Bell Laboratories, Whippany, NJ, 1988-1991-- Member
of Technical Staff.


Software Engineering & Computer Security:





Jointly developed a software development methodology targeted to an
environment where there may be malicious developers attempting
to corrupt the software under development (e.g., insertion of trojan horses).
This methodology integrates fundamental ideas and practices
from software engineering and computer security.




Assessed available support for preventing malicious corruption of software
in a complete suite of software development tools.




Led the development of a prototype tool providing automated support
for assessing the adherence of a software development approach to our
methodology.



System Engineering:





Jointly developed a preliminary design for a special-purpose transaction
processing system. System requirements included the storage and processing
of gigabyte-size databases.




Evaluated a number of real-time, UNIX compatible operating system for
use in a large real-time control system. Developed integration plan for
use of multi-vendor equipments.
