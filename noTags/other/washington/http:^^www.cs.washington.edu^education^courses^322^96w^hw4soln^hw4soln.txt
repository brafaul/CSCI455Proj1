 Number 36 on page 69.  Better yet construct the derivation tree for
.


For the derivations, I'll use the following abbreviations:

<E> means <expression>
<SE> means <simple expression>
<T> means <term>
<F> means <factor>
<AO> means <adding operator>
<MO> means <multiplying operator>
<V> means <variable>
<EV> means <entire variable>
<VI> means <variable identifier>
<I> means <identifier>
<IT> means <identifier tail>
<L> means <letter>
<UC> means <unsigned constant>
<UN> means <unsigned number>
<UI> means <unsigned integer>
<D> means <digit>
<DS> means <digits>

Also, I'm using the following CFG productions in place of their BNF 
equivalents:

<unsigned integer>  <digit> | <digit> <digits> 
<digits>  <digit> <digits> |  
<identifier>  <letter> <identifier tail> 
<identifier tail>  <letter or digit> <identifier tail> |  





 The given grammar is unambiguous because there are two leftmost
derivations for the string ababab:


There are two derivation trees for ababab, as well:



-0.75



-0.75


 The ambiguity in the grammar is due to the 
production.  
The grammar allows multiple derivation trees of any terminal string that
can be derived from .
The following grammar corrects this problem:

Intuitively, what this does is force immediate parsing on the left
side of the string, by forcing the parse to the A productions.  
A formal argument
for why this grammar is ambiguous might come
from the following observation: if we consider any 
string made up of balanced parenthesis, it can be described uniquely as
a set of nested parenthesis surrounding some empty or non-empty string
of balanced parenthesis, concatenated with some empty or
non-empty string of balanced parenthesis.  This description corresponds 
exactly to the grammar: the A productions generate the ``nested'' part 
and the S productions generate the ``concatenated'' part.


 Use the construction given in class for producing a regular grammar
from a regular expression to construct a regular grammar which generates
the language defined by the regular expression .

Since we eventually need to generate a unique set of non-terminals for 
each a and b in the regular expression, we annotate the expression
with indices: .  These indices aren't
intended to mean anything, but we'll use them for bookeeping as we develop the grammar.  For each set of productions, we denote any starting symbol
S as .  If any nonterminal and its productions can be 
eliminated because it is unreachable from the starting symbol, it is 
marked with .











One grammar for the language described by  is then

where P is given by the productions below:



 Suppose  where  in the given grammar.
Properties i) and ii) can be shown to hold for any such x 
by (strong) induction on the length of the leftmost derivation of x.

Basis: (n=1) Suppose  and .  There
is only one such terminal string x, namely x=ab.  
 (property i) ,a, and ab are the only prefixes of 
ab.  For all of these prefixes, the number of a's is at least 
equal to the number of b's.  
 (property ii) 

(Strong) Inductive hypothesis: 
Assume that properties i) and ii) are true for any 
 where  for all .
Inductive step: From this we need to show i) and ii) for any
 where .  There are two 
possibilities for the derivation of x:
 

Since this is a leftmost derivation, we know that
that there exist some y and z where 
.
This means that  and  where
k+j=n.  Thus y and z have leftmost derivations from S of
less than n+1 steps, so properties i) and ii) hold for y and z by 
the induction hypothesis.

(property i) Consider any prefix  of x=yz.  There are two 
possibilities:
  is a prefix of y.  Then 
 
by property i) for y.
  for some prefix of z, .  
Then  by property i) for z and property ii) for y.

In each case of , the number of a's in  is at least
the number of b's in .

(property ii) Since property ii) holds for y and z we have 
.
So the number of a's in x is equal to the number of b's in x.

 
We know that there exists some w where
.
This means that .
Thus w has a leftmost derivation from S of
less than n+1 steps, so properties i) and ii) hold for w by the induction
hypothesis.

(property i) Consider any prefix  of x=awb.  There are three 
possibilities:
 .  
In this case, .
  for some prefix of w, .
Then  
by property i) for w.
 .  Since property ii) holds for w, we have
.

In each case of , the number of a's in  is at least
the number of b's in .

(property ii) Since property ii) holds for w we have 
.
So the number of a's in x is equal to the number of b's in x.


Therefore, for any  where , properties
i) and ii) hold by the principle of strong induction.
