Abstract


The efficient satisfaction of constraints is essential to the performance
of constraint-based user interfaces.  In the past, most constraint-based
user interfaces have used one-way rather than multi-way constraints
because of a widespread belief that one-way constraints were more
efficient.  In this paper we argue that many user interface construction
problems are handled more naturally and elegantly by multi-way constraints
than by one-way constraints.  We present pseudocode for an incremental
multi-way constraint satisfaction algorithm, DeltaBlue, and describe
experience in using the algorithm in two user interface toolkits.  Finally,
we provide performance figures demonstrating that multi-way constraint
solvers can be entirely competitive in performance with one-way constraint
solvers.
