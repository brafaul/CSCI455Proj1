 Abstract 
Cranium is a processor-network interface for an interconnection
network based on adaptive packet routing.  Adaptive networks
relax the restriction that packet order is preserved; packets
may be delivered to their destinations in an arbitrary sequence.
Cranium uses two mechanisms:  an automatic-receive interface
for packet serialization and high performance,
and a rendezvous interface for flexibility.
To minimize software overhead, Cranium is directly accessible
by user-level programs.  Protection for user-level message
passing is implemented by mapping user-level handles into
physical node identifiers and buffer addresses.
