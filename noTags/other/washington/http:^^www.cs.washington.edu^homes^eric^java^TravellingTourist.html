Travelling Tourist





Example of an Interactive Graphics Applet































 The source  of the Traveller
applet (.html), and also for its classes:

 TravellingTourist.source 
 TouristCanvas.source 
 Bus.source 
 Schedule.source 
 Tour.source 
 City.source 
 CityList.source 



I apologize for the change in file names but it's very clear I can't
use the j-word on this page without considerable additional baggage:
see the  trademarks
page by that friendly company who brought us this language in the
first place.


This Travelling Tourist applet is written by 
 Eric Anderson 
starting with (and by now seriously hacked up from) the Line Applet written by
 Siebe Brouwer 

  
Instructions 

  Comments welcome.
