Number 36 on page 69.  Better yet construct the derivation tree for
.

Consider the grammar: .  

By example show that this grammar is ambiguous.

Design an unambiguous grammar which generates the same language
as this grammar.  Explain why your grammar
is unambiguous.

 Use the construction given in class for producing a regular grammar
from a regular expression to construct a regular grammar which generates
the language defined by the regular expression .

Let L be the subset of  where the a's and b's are matched
as parentheses.  The grammar G with
productions  .  
generates this language.  Prove by induction on the length of 
a derivation that if  and 
then x satisfies the two
properties (i) every prefix of x has at least as many a's as b's
and (ii) x has an equal number of a's as b's.

Note that there is only one derivation of length 1, namely, .
For the inductive step, if  then there are two
possibilities  or
.  Your job is to carefully complete
the induction proof using these ideas.
