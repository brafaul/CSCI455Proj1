The UW Internet Raquetball Ladder


The UW Internet Raquetball Ladder




Welcome to the University of Washington Internet Raquetball Ladder!
The Ladder is an ongoing tournament played at the UW IMA
building.  If you are a UW student, faculty, or staff member, 
this is your chance to find players of your own skill level.  It's
fun, it's hip, and it's good for you, too!  You don't need any
experience...you don't even need your own racquet.  All you need is
killer instinct and about an hour a week.  Come on and  get in on
the action!
