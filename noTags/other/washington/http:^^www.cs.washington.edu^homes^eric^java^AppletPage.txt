My Applet Page


 Sample Applets 

The first example is from CSE 521, our introductory algorithms course.
The puzzle is to develop an algorithm for the following modification
of the "travelling salesperson problem", known as the 
"Travelling Tourist" problem:  Given a list of cities, and a schedule
of buses that leave each city, design a travel plan that visits each city at
least once, ends up where you started, and takes a small amount of time.
The 
applet  illustrates some of
the possible tours, on a sample 
data set.

See the 
course projects page for more discussion 

 
of the problem, and the specific 

Speedy Tourist Page.
Also see the
  
instructions  
for specifics on the animation.

The second example is from CSE 523, our introductory computational
geometry course. 
The applet illustrates a plane sweep algorithm used to construct a
Voronoi diagram.

The 
applet  illustrates the operation of 
this algorithm, on sample points input by you, the User.

We've prepared a more 
technical discussion 
as well as
  
instructions  
on the animation itself.

  Comments welcome.
