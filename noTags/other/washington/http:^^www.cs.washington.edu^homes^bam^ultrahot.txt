Best o' the Best


 Web Sites You Should Know 

 The Lyrics
Archive - lyrics for lots of songs
 MetaCrawler - search
multiple Web search engines at once
 The Onion -  a great satirical
newspaper
 TopFive - their lists are
hysterical
 The Ultimate Band List -
everything that exists on the Web about just about every music group
 Plus, how to get rid of junk mail and spams.
