 Bicycle Touring  
 

Let's get this clear right from the start: I love bike touring.  
 

First off, I love to travel, and there's just no better way to see and
experience the countryside than by bike.  You see more than you do when going 
by car because -- let's face it -- you're going slower.  It's also easier
to stop to see those deer or take in that view.  Additionally, you hear and
smell things that you are oblivious to in a noisy, smelly car.  Did I
mention I hate cars?

 Second, it's great exercise.  Biking is low impact, highly aerobic, and
easy to improve in quickly.

 Finally, it's a great way to experience nature.  When you're getting
away from it all, you can leave it further behind if you don't have a car.

 For those of you who care about such things, this is my trusty steed, a
Fisher Zebrano hybrid that I've modified for touring.  I've had it for a year,
and put about 5500 miles on it.  


The Great Pacific Coast Bike Ride


In August, I set out with some especially 
shady
characters on a bicycle expedition down the Pacific Coast, from Seattle
to San Francisco (I continued on to San Diego).  These comrades-in-lycra
were Marc
Friedman, Ruben Ortega, and Jim
Giordano.  We camped
out almost every night, and shared our campsites with wild
animals, but we didn't let the harshness of our surroundings prevent us
from preparing gourmet
meals.  We generally cooked breakfast and dinner, and went out for lunch.
Despite eating on the bikes, we were generally very hungry
by the time we stopped for lunch.  Here's an abbreviated mileage log of our
trip.
