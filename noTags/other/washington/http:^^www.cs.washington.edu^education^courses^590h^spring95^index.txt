I don't want to duplicate all of Aaron's great work, so for now, here's a
pointer to the University
of Washington UI Students' Web (which is a good starting point).

Supported Cooperative Learning) page.

Three interesting papers from
Lancaster Univ. about ethnography:

 "Moving out from the control room: ethnography in system design"
