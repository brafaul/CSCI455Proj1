The Halting Problem



The halting problem is defined to be:

Input: Turing machine M and binary input x,

Property: M halts on input x.


 Theorem: The halting problem is undecidable.

 Proof:  The proof is by contradiction.  
Suppose that the halting problem is decidable.
Then there must be a Turing machine H with the
property that H halts on all inputs, and accepts  if and only if 
M halts on input x.
(Recall that  is the binary representation of the Turing machine M.)

We define a new Turing machine D which does the following on inputs of
the form .

Copy the input  to form the string .

Run H on the input .

If H halts without accepting then D halts.

If H halts and accepts then D simply loops forever.


There are two possibilities, D halts on input  or D does
not halt on input .
We will come to a contradiction in both cases.

If  D halts on input , then by the definition of H,
H accepts
.  By the definition of D, D does not halt on input .

If  D does not halt on input , then by the definition of H,
H halts on input  without accepting.  
By the definition of D, D halts on input .
