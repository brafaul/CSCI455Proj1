CSE 500/490B -- Links to Other Resources

Alan Borning



A somewhat arbitrary collection of links to other online resources.  Please
send suggestions for additional links to add (or to remove -- there is a
lot of stuff out there, not all of it useful).



Censorship and the Net; First Amendment Issues

Obviously the links below are sorted alphabetically rather than by position
on the issues!

American
        Civil Liberties Union of Washington
Center for Democracy and Technology
Christian Coalition
Electronic Frontier Foundation
Family Research Council
Internet filters
  
Bess Net (a filtered internet provider)
  SurfWatch (software to block
    access to sexually explicit material)
  see also PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) -- this is
    apparently a rating and identification system being developed by
    Microsoft, Netscape, and others -- I don't have any links though

Network links from the Boulder

SCN has information stored in two formats: a menu-based system (usable with
any ascii terminal), and Web pages.  The menu-based information is mirrored
in the Web pages, so it's easiest to browse on the Web.  You can also
telnet to scn.org and login as "visitor" to browse.  



Both the SCN and Boulder web pages also have links to many other community
networks.
