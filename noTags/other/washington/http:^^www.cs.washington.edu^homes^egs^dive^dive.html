Dive Computers and Diving Simulations

Several years ago, I wrote a dive computer that can simulate a variety
of exponential models used in current dive computers. It graphically 
displays the saturation of model compartments, and calculates
time-to-decompress and decompression-ceiling, as well as individual
ceilings for each compartment. Here's the source
code for my dive computer, diver. It requires an X-capable
graphics terminal. 

Personal History

I have done most of my ~60 dives in Turkey, around Datca, Kalkan and Kas. I
worked for three weeks as a dive guide in Datca when I was on vacation
there. If you have questions about diving in Turkey, feel free to send
me email.

Lately, I have been snorkeling and free-diving instead of using
scuba. When snorkeling, I enjoy going deep. With scuba, I really enjoy
solo night dives as a form of meditation. Most of the time, though, I
dive with friends and follow more conservative profiles.
