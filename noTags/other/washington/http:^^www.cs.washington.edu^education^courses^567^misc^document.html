CSE 567: Principles of Digital Systems Design 
Carl Ebeling, Fall 1996 

Notes on synthesis for homework #3.

Cadence online documentation.
To get to the Cadence online documenation, run "openbook".  You'll
probably have to source the $UW_VLSI_TOOLS/setups/cadence.cshrc file
first.  We use Verilog-XL simulator for all our simulation.  The
documentation you might want to look at are under "HDL
Tools->Verilog-XL Simulation":

Verilog-XL Reference
Verilog-XL Tutorial 
Verilog-XL User Guide


Synopsys online documentation.
To get to the Synopsys online documentation, run "iview".  You'll
probably have to source the $UW_VLSI_TOOLS/setups/synopsys.cshrc file
first.  The Synopsys documentation of interest includes:

Synthesis:
   
HDL Compiler for Verilog Reference Manual
   FPGA Compiler Reference Manua
   
Tutorials:
   
DesignSource Tutorial for Verilog
