(Thanks to P. Kromann for the trick on this one)
A DPDA for the given language:  



The computation of abbac:



 where
,
, , 
and the function  consists of only these rules:


 
Here's a Turing machine that accepts :



Here's a brief description of  all the states:
 : Read the first blank.
 : This is the start of the match loop.  It looks for an a 
or a b.  If it sees a c, then we're done matching the first string.
 : We've read a b and we're looking for the c.
 : We've read an a and we're looking for the c.
 : we're trying to match the b.
 : we're trying to match the a.
 : Scan left for the c.
 : Scan left for the next thing to match in the first string.
 : Verify that there is no other input in the second string.
 : We've matched everything in the first string and found 
nothing else in the second string, so accept the input.

Its computation of the input abcab:



Let .  Assume all the productions in P, not of the form
, are numbered 1 to m.

The PDA  will accept
the language generated by G.  We need to specify Q and .

The function  consists of the following rules:
