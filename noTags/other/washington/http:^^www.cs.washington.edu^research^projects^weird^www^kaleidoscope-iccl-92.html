Abstract

Two major paradigms in computer programming languages are
imperative and declarative programming.  We describe a
scheme for languages that integrate specific features from these two
paradigms into a new framework: Constraint Imperative Programming.  Along
with the framework, we discuss the design and implementation of a
particular instance of this framework, Kaleidoscope'90.  From the
imperative paradigm, constraint imperative programming adopts explicit
control flow, state, and assignment.  From the declarative paradigm, it
adopts explicit, system-maintained constraints (relations that should
hold).  There is a strong practical motivation for making this integration:
in a typical application, some portions are most clearly described using
imperative constructs, while other portions are most clearly described
using constraints.  By using a constraint imperative language, the most
suitable paradigm can be used as appropriate.
