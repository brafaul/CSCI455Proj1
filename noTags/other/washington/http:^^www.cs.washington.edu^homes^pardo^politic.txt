THE  NETWORK  OBSERVER
VOLUME 2, NUMBER 2
FEBRUARY 1995


  I don't know if it was Newt Gingrich's idea originally, but he
  supports it and it's real -- the Thomas legislative information
  service on WWW.  Check it out.  The URL is http://thomas.loc.gov/
  Right now it's not all that impressive, but it's a start anyway.
  Next step -- figure out what features and documents it's missing,
  make sure everyone on the net knows to want them, and make sure
  everyone in Washington knows that everyone on the net wants them.
  By the way, the House gopher is at
  gopher://gopher.house.gov/


  Lindsay Marshall  has put the
  complete Risks Digest on the web.  He says that individual issues
  look like
  
  	http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/16.01.html
  where 16.01
  is the volume and issue number, and the most recent issue is at
  
  	http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/latest


  Ol' Newt is everywhere.  Mother Jones printed some of the first
  useful articles on the guy, and now they've put them on-line
  on their web server
  http://www.mojones.com/
  The first of these
  articles, from 1984 -- and that's 1984, not 1994 -- tells us,
  among many other things, "Gingrich told several intimates in 1974
  that his goal was to be Speaker of the House".  It can be found
  at
  
  	http://www.mojones.com/N84/osborne.html


  What?  You haven't had enough of Newt yet?  The Newt Gingrich
  WWW Fan Club is at
  
  	http://www.clark.net/pub/jeffd/mr_newt.html
  This page includes a pointer to the under-construction Progress
  and Freedom Foundation home page, whose erstwhile nonexistence
  I remarked upon in TNO 1(12).


  You can even read the Heritage Foundation's theoretical journal,
  Policy Review, on gopher.  This is the best place to find out
  where the highly organized forces of the conservative movement
  are headed next.  Required reading for all liberals.  The URL is

  You must check out the web archive of a mailing list about moving
  assets offshore.  It's a whole subculture and quite continuous
  with the general tone of libertarianism on much of the net and in
  many manifestos of the hacker movement.  The URL for the archive
  is:

  I'm told that
  the way to subscribe to the mailing list is by sending a message
  whose body is "sub" to offshore@dnai.com.


  I was charmed to discover the web page for the Indonesian menu
  at Bachri's Indonesian and Middle-Eastern Restaurant in Castle

Advocacy Homepage announced by American Arts Alliance

In response to the imminent threat to the survival of the National
Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the American Arts Alliance is pleased
to announce the creation of an "advocacy homepage" and gopher site
accessible to the millions Internet users.  The homepage provides
advocacy information and tools for arts supporters to communicate the
need for continued federal support of the arts to their senators and
representatives.

This information, which includes our 900 number, a sample letter, NEA
facts and general information, greatly advances the the arts community's
continuing efforts to generate support for the NEA through local
grassroots contacts with elected officials.  In addition to educating
the public and expanding the base of potentially interested parties,
computer users can easily transform the data into a uniquely personal
letter to send to their leaders in Washington.

The American Arts Alliance is available on the Arts Wire WWW site.
The URL:  http://www.tmn.com/0h/Artswire/www/aaa/aaahome.html

This information is also available on the Arts Wire gopher:

 Address: gopher.tmn.com
 Once there choose Menu Item #5, Artswire.
 At the next menu, select American Arts Alliance
