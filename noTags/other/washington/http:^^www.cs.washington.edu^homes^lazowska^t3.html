Ode to T III




Ode to T III

We send you off

To conquer realms

Tallman Trask

With Jesse Helms.


Yes, Tallman's gone

It's just the pits

To black-eyed peas

And hominy grits.


He'll change his name

It won't be hard

From Tallman Trask

To Beauregard.


From us up North

He'll want much more

We'll have another

Civil War.


The words will flow

From Tallman's pen

The South will surely

Rise again.


-- John N. "Bard" Lein, M.D.

Ed Lazowska presents a memento of Tallman's unprecedented
contributions to the University of Washington's
facilities -- bulldozers surrounding a tree with an
individual chained to it.
