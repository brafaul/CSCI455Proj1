Abstract

Constraints are declarative statements of relations among elements of the
language's computational domain, e.g., integers, booleans, strings, and
other objects.  Orthogonally, the tools of object-oriented programming,
including encapsulation, inheritance, and dynamic message binding, provide
important mechanisms for extending a language's domain.  Although the
integration of constraints and objects seems obvious and natural, one basic
obstacle stands in the way: objects provide a new, larger, computational
domain, which the language's embedded constraint solver must accommodate.
In this paper we list some goals and non-goals for an integration of
constraints and object oriented language features, outline previous
approaches to this integration, and describe the scheme we use in
Kaleidoscope'91, our object-oriented constraint imperative programming
language.  Kaleidoscope'91 uses a class-based object model,
multi-methods, and constraint constructors to integrate cleanly the
encapsulation and abstraction of a state-of-the-art object-oriented
language with the declarative aspects of constraints.
