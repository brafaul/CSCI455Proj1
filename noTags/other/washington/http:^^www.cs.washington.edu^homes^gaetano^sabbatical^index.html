 Gaetano Borriello - Sabbatical Index 

Our Sabbatical Year

From August 1995 to August 1996 we were in Pisa, 
Italy.  Gaetano spent the year at the 
Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna.  

This page contains a combination of travelogue, comments, and musings on our 
sabbatical year in Pisa, Italy.  We'll try to update it a few times over the 
course of the year but its pretty tough to find the time to write.  If it 
weren't for the fact that Melissa is such a conscientious correspondent you 
probably wouldn't hear from us at all until we returned.

Our schedule - just in case you are planning to visit.
