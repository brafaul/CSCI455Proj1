Distributed Transactions in a Mobile Computing System


Distributed Transactions in a Mobile Computing System

This paper was submitted as part of
the requirement for CSE552, Autumn 1993.

It is necessary to reexamine distributed transaction processing issues
in mobile computing systems to account for characteristics of mobile
computers like slow, unreliable communication, disconnected operation
and location dependence.  This study mainly discusses issues that
arise due to low-bandwidth high-latency wireless communication of
mobile systems. Mobile computers can be treated simply as I/O device,
as full fledged database servers, or as something in-between where
local data is treated as a cache for the primary copy. A method for
handling transactions using a batched transaction approach is
presented and discussed. Implementation is on to test performance of
this method.
