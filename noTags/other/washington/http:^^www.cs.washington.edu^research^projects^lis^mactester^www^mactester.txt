Information for MacTester developers
Source code
Click  here to
access the MacTester source code for the Macintosh.  You will need
the Macintosh utility ``StuffIt'' in order to extract files from the archive.
The preferred compiler for this version of the C library code
(2.2) is Think C version 5.0 and above.
This library code also compiles for the IBM PC under Microsoft Quick C, but
you still need to use StuffIt to perform the extraction.
