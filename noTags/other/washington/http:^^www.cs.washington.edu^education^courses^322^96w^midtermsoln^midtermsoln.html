We will use the technique given in the handout and explained by Jim
Fix to construct a regular grammar for .
Since we eventually need to generate a unique set of non-terminals for 
each a and b in the regular expression, we annotate the expression
with indices: .  These indices aren't
intended to mean anything, but we'll use them for bookeeping as we develop the grammar.  For each set of productions, we denote any starting symbol
S as .  If any nonterminal and its productions can be 
eliminated because it is unreachable from the starting symbol, it is 
marked with .







Thus the final grammar constructed is:




.

.
Each production is used once.


.


With start symbol  the grammar is:



The meaning of  is that the number of a's generated by  is
equal to .

 
The fact we are trying to prove is that if  has
an equal number of a's as b's then .  This
will be proved by induction on n where |x| = 2n.

The basis is n=0.  The only string of length 0 is . 
 in one step.

The inductive hypothesis is: If w is a string in  with an equal
number of a's as b's and |w| < 2n, then .

Case 1 of the induction step.  Recall that we are assuming that
x has an equal number of a's as b's, |x| = 2n and n > 0.
In case 1 there is a string y such that x =yz, y has
an equal number of a's as b's, , and .

Since both x and  y have an equal number of a's as b's then
it must be the case that z does also.
Since  then |y| < 2n.  Since  then it
must be the case that |z| < 2n.  Thus, both y and z satisfy the
hypothesis of the inductive hypothesis. 
Hence,  and .  By using the
first production with these two derivations we have the derivation.
