Assignment 8 Solution Set

Consider the NFA  
where  is given by the table:


We can construct a DFA  where 
 is given by the table (using the subset construction):


and where 
 
and
.

 
Below are the steps for converting the NFA of problem 1 into a regular
expression. We start with the original NFA:





First, we make a new start state that has no incoming arcs:





Next, make a new final state with no outgoing arcs:





Eliminate a state.  The state  looks like a good candidate:





Eliminate state :





Eliminate :





Accounting for the final start state, the equivalent regular expression is
. This can be simplified to
.

 Proof that that regular languages are closed under reversal:
Suppose the language L over  is regular.  
It must be accepted by some NFA 
.  
Consider the NFA  where


We will show that  accepts  with the following behavioral lemma:

 Behavioral Lemma: For all , 
 if and only if 
.

Given that this lemma is true, we can prove that .
Suppose  and .  Let x = ay for 
and .  Note that .  It follows that:


Suppose that  and .  Again, let x=ay:


Consider when :


Combining these observations, we have , and so 
there is an NFA that accepts .
Thus, if L is regular,  is regular.
