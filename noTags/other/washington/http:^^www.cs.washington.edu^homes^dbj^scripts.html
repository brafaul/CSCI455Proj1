Guidelines For Writing HTTP Server Scripts



Guidelines For Writing HTTP Server Scripts



This document is intended to be an evolving series of ideas, pointers
and other information about writing programs that can be executed by
following a WWW link, with particular emphasis on security issues.

The rest of this document assumes that you already know how to write
programs. It also doesn't attempt to cover the same ground as
NCSA's introduction to
forms, which should be be considered the starting point for
explorations of forms. You should also be sure to read the Common Gateway Interface
documentation as well, which describes the interface that the HTTP
server defines between HTML messages and server-side executables.

Security

The potential problems with security cannot be overemphasized. Unlike
existing network protocols, which generally allow either:


 specified users to execute arbitrary code
 arbitrary users to execute specified code


the existence of server-side scripts effectively permits


 arbitrary users to execute arbitrary code


although clearly, the scope of "abitrary" in this case is at least
somewhat reduced (specifically: arbitrary users can execute any
program installed in a ScriptAlias location prior to the last HTTP
server restart).

There are some basic features of server-side scripts that if used
correctly will minimize the potential for security problems:


NEVER, EVER treat data received from a remote source as
    instructions to be executed.
NEVER, EVER assume that necessary arguments are present,
    and exit gracefully if this is the case. ALWAYS check
    that such arguments are in fact present.
ALWAYS have the program exit gracefully if it receives
    arguments it does not understand.
NEVER assume the size of the arguments or the data received
    by the program. Always check the expected size of these objects
    or know that the interpreter you are using (awk, sh, for example),
    will make sane, secure decisions if an overflow occurs.
NEVER trust any claimed remote identity (HTTP does not
    currently support anything more secure than passwords, which are
    not very secure at all).

The Basic Idea

When you follow a link using a URL of the form:

	http://foo.bar.baz/a/b/c


the HTTP server at foo.bar.baz will check each successively longer
substring of /a/b/c (ie. /a,
/a/b, etc.) against the list of "ScriptAliases" defined
in the server's configuration files. A ScriptAlias looks like this:


ScriptAlias /a /some/other/place/in/the/filesystem/a


which the server interprets to mean: if anyone ever references
/a/something, then execute
/some/other/place/in/the/filesystem/a and return its
output. Note that this implies two things about the executed program:
it must send a MIME Content-Type header as its first line of output,
to tell the client (Mosaic) what the output actually is (HTML ? GIF ?
JPEG ? etc), and then it should send some "useful" output, even if its
only an "OK, message received" line. See the mail-request
mentioned below for an example of how to do this.
Only programs located in places referenced by a ScriptAlias
will ever be executed by the server. In addition, the server caches a
directory listing of all the programs in each location referenced in a
ScriptAlias whenever it is started (or restarted),
and uses it to check possible server-side programs before executing
them. This prevents random programs placed in the right place from
being accessed without a server restart (which only a priviledged user
can do). 
What about arguments ? What about input ?

Once the HTTP server has discovered that /a/b is actually
an executable program in a ScriptAlias location, it executes the
program, passing it data in two ways.

First of all, any text left over from the URL that has not been "used"
to find the script will be used to set the value of an environment
variable named PATH_INFO. In the example above, this would relatively
simple: PATH_INFO would just be /c. However, near
arbitrary text can be used here:

http:/foo.bar.baz/a/b/long=4748.39?//limit:=$!!:h+aposto:*&%&^$$#{fhfh}


This will result in PATH_INFO being set to:

/long=4748.39?//limit:=$!!:h+aposto:*&%&^$$#{fhfh}


(note the initial `/'). The main restriction is that spaces are not
allowed, or rather, will terminate the component of the URL used to
set PATH_INFO.

In addition, if you are using a forms interface, the values of all the
<input> and <select> tags in the
form will be made available, as the standard input of the
program. 
Encoding

This will be 
encoded to guarantee safe transmission. This encoding is an
important issue, because to make reasonable use of the data sent to
your program, you need to decode it. Fortunately, you don't *have* to
do this yourself. For the time being, a filter called
urldecode can be used by your own programs (easily if
they are an actual shell,awk or perl script) to do the decoding.
Invoke it as:


/cse/www/htbin-post/urldecode


and it will convert any encoded data read from its standard input into
its original form on its standard output. At some point, I'll add a
object module you can link with to do this from a compiled langauge
like C (although you may get there before me, since the encoding is so
simple).

More details are available about writing server scripts in the Common Gateway Interface
documentation, where a number of other environment variables that
are available to the program are described.
How to do this locally

Currently, only two areas have been named using ScriptAliases. One of
them is not currently publically accessible (the filesystem it
resides on is not exported to the rest of the department's machines).
The other is intended for use by participants in the 590i seminar
taking place this quarter:


	/projects/ai/590i/post-bin


An example program, called mail-request, is already there
(its a shell/awk script). This is the program I use for the interface
to my music collection, so take a look
at the HTML source for that stuff to see how this is used. I intended
it to be usable by anyone else, and a for a variety of
purposes. Suggestions are welcome.

The HTTP daemon will be restarted about 4 times a day, and on the next
restart after you have placed a program there, you will able to have a
link to it result in its execution. After that, you can keep changing
the program in any way you see fit, and the daemon won't care - it
merely notes prescence or absence.
I want to reiterate that this is potentially a big security issue.
Please take care in how you handle arguments, how to handle input and
what your program does or might do.

For the time being, all instances of these programs will run as the
uid "nobody". Also access to both areas (the private one and the 590i
area) is currently limited to machines in the .cs.washington.edu
domain. This restriction is inconvenient, and intended to create a
temporary breathing space so that we can get more experience with
potential security issues.
