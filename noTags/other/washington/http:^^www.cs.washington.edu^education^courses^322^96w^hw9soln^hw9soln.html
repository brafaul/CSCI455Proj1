 CSE 322 Winter 1996: Assignment 9 Solution Set


Let  and
 be NFAs.
Construct a new NFA M that accepts the language


Let  where
for all , , 


 Behavioral Lemma: 
For all , ,
, , and
, 

if and only if

and
.


Suppose  is regular.
If we intersect L with any regular language, the resulting
language is also regular.
For instance,  is regular.
But , and we know that
this language is not regular from class.  This is a contradiction
so L must not be regular.


Show that the language  is not regular.

Assume L is regular, and let  
be a DFA that accepts L.  Suppose Q contains n states.
Consider the computation of M on any string of length n or more.
Because there are only n total states, some state will be visited more
than once during the computation.  For example, when M processes the
string , the computation looks like this:

for some , , and .  
Because we visit the same state twice, we can remove 
 from the string and still end in the same state:

This means that .  However,
.  Also, note that
since  and , 
2n+1 must be greater than j-i.  This means that
.  So  falls strictly between
 and , two consecutive perfect squares.
Therefore,  is not a perfect square and
.  This is a contradiction, 
so L must not be regular.
