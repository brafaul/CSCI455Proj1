Vivek Narasayya -- Personal Information


 Personal Information 

I'm a graduate student in the Deptarment of Computer Science at the
University of Washington.
 My roots 

My home town is a small place called Sakleshpur, in the state of 
Karnataka
in India. Back in 1956,
after his retirement, my grandfather bought some land near Sakleshpur and
developed a coffee estate. The area around Sakleshpur is ideal for growing
coffee, and most of the coffee grown and exported by India comes from this
region. It's a mountainous region with volcanic soil and heavy (100+ inches
a year) rainfall. The estate is now being run by my parents. One day, I'll
be there too.

I grew up in Bangalore
(formerly known as the Garden City -- now known as the Silicon City),
which is the capital of Karnataka. It's about 150 miles east of
Sakleshpur. Bangalore has changed a whole lot in the past 5 years, 
with all those high-tech multinationals opening shop and pouring in
big bucks. 

Other Stuff
Indiaworld has up to date news from
India, and articles from Indian newspapers and magazines.
