Smalltalk quiz sample solution


    For many of these questions, there were a number of reasonable
solutions. I've tried to pick ones that are clean, somewhat efficient,
but not overly tricky. 
    I haven't actually typed this code in and tried to run it, so I
apologize in advance for any typos. 



 (a)


max: aNumber
    ^ self > aNumber ifTrue: [^self] ifFalse: [^aNumber]

 (b)


isBigger: aCollection
    ^ self size > aCollection size

 (c)


isNumeric
    self do: [:elem| elem isNumber ifFalse: [^false]] .
    ^true

 (d)


numOccurances: anObject
    | counter |
    counter := 0 .    
    self do: [:elem | elem == anObject ifTrue: [ counter := counter + 1 ] .
    ^ counter 

 (e)


sumSquares: aCollection
    | sum |
    sum := 0 .
    self isNumeric ifFalse: [ self error: 'Non numeric collection' ] .
    self do: [:elem| sum := sum + (elem * elem)].
    ^sum




 (a)
 I was looking for a discussion that clearly articulated these
two main points: 

 There is only one copy of the class variable, which is shared by
all instances of the class. Each instance of the class gets its own,
private, copy of the instance variable. This distinction between
shared and non-shared variables was the big idea.
 A secondary idea was that class variables are accessible (may be
read/written) from both 
class and instance methods, while instance variables can only be
accessed from instance methods, and thus have more limited visibility.

 (b)


 Account instance methods


serviceAccount
    self subclassResponsibility

 CheckingAccount instance methods


serviceAccount
    self assessServiceCharge

 SavingsAccount instance methods


serviceAccount
    self payInterest

 Collection instance methods


serviceAccounts
    self do: [:acct| acct serviceAccount] .


 (c)


showDifference
    "Returns 5 if instance variables, 6 if class variable"
    |a b|
    a := SomeClass new: 2
    b := SomeClass new: 3
    ^ a access + b access


 
    To implement add:, I used an approach based on double dispatching,
which is how this kind of thing is usually actually done in the
Smalltalk standard library.  There were a number of other solutions
that were perfectly fine (based on sending an isNumber, or isInteger,
or isComplex message to the argument of add). 

 Class defintion


Number subclass: #ComplexNumber
    instanceVariableName: 'real imaginary'
    classVariableName: ''
    category: 'Magnitude-Numbers'

 Complex Number Class Methods


new
    ^self real: 0 imaginary: 0

real: aNumber imaginary: anotherNumber
    ^ super new real: aNumber imaginary: anotherNumber


 Complex Number Instance Methods


real: aNumber imaginary: anotherNumber
    real := aNumber .
    imaginary := anotherNumber .
    ^self 

real
    ^ real

imaginary
    ^ imaginary

add: aNumber
    ^ aNumber addWithComplex self

addWithComplex: aComplexNumber
    "The first version of the add method looked like this"
    |r i|
    r := self real + aComplexNumber real .
    i := self imaginary + aComplexNumber imaginary .
    ^ self class real: r imaginary: i

multiply: aComplexNumber
    "If I was really doing this, I'd do double dispatching again"
    |r i|
    r := (self real * aComplexNumber real) -
    	    (self imaginary + aComplexNumber imaginary) .
    i := (self real * aComplexNumber imaginary) +
    	    (self imaginary * aComplexNumber real) .
    ^ self class real: r imaginary: i

 Number Instance Methods


addWithComplex aComplexNumber
    ^ (ComplexNumber real: self imaginary: 0) add: aComplexNumber
