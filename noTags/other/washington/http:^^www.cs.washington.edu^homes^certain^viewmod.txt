Netscape Configuration Changes 



After unpacking the tar file (which contains two executables, MRAViewer.const and
MRAViewer.linear), place the resulting executables somewhere in your
path.  Then add the following lines to your personal types file (it's
usually ~/.mime.types - see Preferences under the Options menu and
choose "Helper Applications"):
application/x-mramesh   mrh
application/x-mramesh-linear   mrl

If you are on a machine that supports texture mapping, add these lines
to your personal mailcap file (usually ~/.mailcap):
application/x-mramesh;  MRAViewer.const -T %s
application/x-mramesh-linear;  MRAViewer.linear %s

Otherwise, add these lines: 
application/x-mramesh;  MRAViewer.const %s
application/x-mramesh-linear;  MRAViewer.linear %s

You're ready.
