Not All Bits are Created Equal.


research projects


Some past research projects:


Evaluation and application of feature selection algorithms.  (with
Anil Jain.)
Here is a paper presented at ICPR 96 (postscript version), and a
similar paper has been accepted to IEEE PAMI.

Classification of handprinted digits using deformable templates.
(also with Anil Jain.)  This paper has been submitted to IEEE
PAMI.

Some genetic programming work, with
Bill Punch.  I wrote a
genetic programming system in C called lil-gp,
which has gained some popularity in the GP community.  Work done using
lil-gp turned into a paper at the
GP workshop of ICGA-95, an expanded version of which
appears in Advances in Genetic Programming II, MIT Press.
