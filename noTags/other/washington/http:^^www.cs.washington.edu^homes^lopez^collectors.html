The Star Wars Collectors Archive
Created by  Gus Lopez  (lopez@cs.washington.edu).

When people think of Star Wars,
the first thing that comes to mind is the popular
series of movies that inspired a generation of kids, adults, and movie-makers
around
the world.  The influence of Star Wars on motion pictures is well-known.
What is less well-known is that Star Wars grossed more money from
merchandising than from box office receipts, which is a remarkable achievement
considering that the Star Wars trilogy broke box office records at the
time of release.  Just about any piece of Star Wars
merchandise can be considered a collectible, and that's why we're here.
This archive is a virtual museum of some of the finest private collections of
Star Wars memorabilia in the world.

Much of the information contained here is researched and written by
Chris Georgoulias (stuntboy@ols.net)
Additional documents by  Chris Nichols  (anichols@bucknell.edu) and  Martin Thurn  (thurn@cis.ohio-state.edu).
Lots of clever HTML tricks and suggestions by  Andy King  (sailorcw@ix.netcom.com).
