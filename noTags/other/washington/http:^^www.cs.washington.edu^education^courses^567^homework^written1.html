 Prove the following simplification theorems using only axioms and
theorems T1-6 and T9-10 from the notes:


a. (A+B)(A+B') = A

b. (A+B)(A'+B) = AB+A'B

 Use DeMorgan's law to complement:

ABC+B(C'+D')

 Simplify the following using the theorems of Boolean algebra:

f(X,Y,Z) = (X+Y)(X'+Y+Z)(X'+Y+Z')

 Rewrite the following in Product of Sums form, not necessarily
minimized:

f(A,B,C,D) = AB + CD + AC' + A'D

 Implement the logic function f(A,B,C,D,E) =  ABCDE 
using 2-input NAND gates only.  Try to minimize worst-case delay.
What is the worst-case delay of your circuit assuming each NAND gate
has a delay of 2 ns?


 Find a three-variable function that is its own dual.  (This
highlights the fact that duality and complementation are very
different.)

 A 2-bit comparator compares two 2-bit numbers A and B and
generates two results, A>B and A=B.

a. Implement a 2-bit comparator.

b. Use the 2-bit comparator that you designed in part (a) to construct
at 4-bit comparator.

c. Extend the method you used for part (b) to describe how to
implement an n-bit comparator for arbitrary n.  Assuming that each
logic gate has a delay of 1 (unit-delay model), what is the delay of
your n-bit comparator as a function of n?

d. (Extra credit) If your answer for part (c) was not O(logn) then
find a solution that is.

 Consider a three-out-of-five majority gate called M5,  whose
output is 1 if at least three of its five inputs are 1.
a. Show how to implement a 2-input AND gate using M5 with the inputs
connected appropriately.
b. Show how to impement a 3-input OR gate using M5.
c. Can you use M5 to implement an inverter?
