Abstract:
This report describes the implementation of a new parallel algorithm
for finding clusters point sets of Euclidean space.
A new solution to a special case of the  bichromatic closest pairs
problem is used by the algorithm.
The implementation was done in an environment
for distributed tree computations on the Kendall Square Research KSR-2
multiprocessor.
