I am now in search of a topic to pursue my PhD on.  For my
PhD. qualifier, I studied the problem of quickly finding approximately
matching clones in a restriction mapping experiment.  I came up with
an interesting algorithm to speed up the process and analyzed some of
the tradeoffs.  I think that the ideas behind the algorithm are
general enough to define a general scheme for approximate matching in
other contexts.  I was advised mainly by professor Larry Ruzzo
, and also by professor Karp. 

Recenlty, professors Oren Etzioni, Steve
Hanks,
Tao Jiang and I began investigating a
fairly new problem: the metacrawler's
problem!  We introduced a few optimization models and came up with
approximation algorithms under those models.
