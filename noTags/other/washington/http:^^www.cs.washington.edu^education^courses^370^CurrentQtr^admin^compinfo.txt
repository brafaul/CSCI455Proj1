CSE370 Computing Information

Computing Platforms
We will be using the Intel PCs located in Sieg 232.  These machines have
64MB of RAM and 1.5GB hard drives in addition to their fast Pentium
processors.  They are also equipped with a 17-in color monitor.
There will be no eating or drinking in the laboratory and you are 
expected to behave civilly at all times.  

These machines were donated to the department by Intel Corporation
of Hillsboro, OR.

Writing and Drawing Tools
All the machines have Microsoft Office residing on their disks.  This
is a suite of tools that includes word processing and figure drawing
programs that you will be expected to use for writing up your
assignments (you may of course use equivalent software you may have
on your home machine).  

This software was donated to the department 
by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, WA.

Logic Design Tools
For virtually the entire quarter we will be using a set of tools called
Synario.  These include a logic schematics editor, a compiler to 
programmable logic devices and field programmable gate arrays, an
integrated logic simulator, and a state diagram drawing tool with its
own compiler.  You will use these tools to specify, synthesize, and
simulate your design and will incorporate schematics, state diagrams, 
and simulator output into the write-up of your assignments.  

These professional tools were donated to the department by 
Data-I/O Corporation of Redmond, WA.
