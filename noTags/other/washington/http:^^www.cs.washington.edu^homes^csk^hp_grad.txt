C.W.E. Grad Photos



Here are some photos from our graduation ball.




Here's a shot of Leo and me, looking very content and somewhat worn
	out, after a lot of eating, drinking, and merrymaking.  Leo says that
	this photo will one day hang in the Smithsonian, as a picture of the
	two of us together.  I like that idea.






	Nath, Chris and I hanging out during cocktails.  Yes, I'm making
	a silly face, but on the whole it's a good picture of the three of us.
	








	The Group Photo.  After a lot of scrambling, grabbing people, begging
	the protographers, and careful positioning, we managed to produce this
	photo.  Sorry to those of you who were not present.  A key is provided
	below to help identify the people in the photo.
