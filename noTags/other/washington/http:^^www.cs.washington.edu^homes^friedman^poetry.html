  Other People's Poems 

I've been studying German on my own.  I'm reading Heinrich Heine's
poems lately, because they're short!

  Here's one  to live by.
    Here's a favorite  that I just
love.


People really ought to read more Friedrich Nietzsche.  So I put these
here.  These are in English.
  
  Of the Three Metamorphoses 
  The Charcoal and the Diamond
