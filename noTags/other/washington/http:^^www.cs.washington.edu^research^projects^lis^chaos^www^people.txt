Who's who in Chaos:
 The Chaos Router is a Non-Minimal Adaptive Packet Router which
uses randomization to probabilistically avoid livelock.  The concept
of chaotic routing was invented by Smaragda Konstantinidou and 
Lawrence Snyder  in 1990.  In 1993, a design team led by  Kevin Bolding 
built the first  Chaos Router chip  with the
help of lots of people, including 
Sen-Ching Cheung, 
 Sung-Eun Choi  ,
 Carl Ebeling ,
 Soha Hassoun  ,
Ton Ngo, and Robert Wille.

 Neil McKenzie 
finished a network interface design that provides low latency access
for User-Level messages.

In addition to building hardware, our group has been studying routing
in general.  We have implemented a simulator with capabilities for
real-time visualization to study Chaos and other routing techniques.
In particular, our simulator can vary many different characteristics
including routing algorithm, buffer size, message lengths and
switching technique to name a few.   Sung-Eun Choi,
created the graphical interface.

Melanie Fulgham  has studied many aspects of Chaotic routing with

non-uniform  traffic loads. 
 Thu Nguyen  has
experimented with minimal adaptive routing algorithms.



Our group is also interested in theoretical research in routing.
 Donald Chinn ,
 et al. proved a lower bound on minimal adaptive
routing on a mesh with bounded queue size.
