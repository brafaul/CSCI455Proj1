The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics emphasizes that to motivate
students in math and science, curricula should include open-ended
investigations in cooperative group settings.  In addition to
increasing the appeal of some mathematically-oriented activities,
the cooperative aspect encourages the development of students'
communication skills relative to mathematical content.



The METIP project has designed and developed four multiplayer
activities which enable co-present or face-to-face learning.
Currently these activities use up to four mice using the "Access.bus"
multiple-mouse setup from Computer Access Technology.  The METIP
project has develope an experimental environment to
support the development software using an application program
interface (API).  This allows us to rapidly create cooperative
applications that are independent of tyep type of input device used.
Activities are developed in C, C++ or Visual Basic on Microsoft Windows
3.1.


The activities developed thus far:


 A color-matching game for three players,
 A chord-matching game,
 A cooperative curve-fitting game, and 
 A geometrical midpoint activity


These activities were designed as part of the METIP
project and were supported in part by the National Science Foundation under
grant number MDR-9155709.
