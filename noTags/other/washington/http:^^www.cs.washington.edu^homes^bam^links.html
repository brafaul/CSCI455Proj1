 bam's glorified hotlist 


 Links 

   I have an odd collection of links.  I don't necessarily agree with
what's in them, and I haven't even looked at many of them yet.  Some are
cheesy, some are esoteric, and a lot aren't quite what I wanted. But
they're all links that interested me, and links that I wanted to be able
to recall easily so I could (re)explore them.  My page, like anything else
on the Web, is mostly a glorified hotlist. 

   Clicking on a picture on this page or the pages beneath it will
take you to the site I stole the picture from.  Don't forget to look
at my personal page to see links to the
things I'm most interested in.

   And away we go...

 The Sights, Sounds, and
Smells of the Web
