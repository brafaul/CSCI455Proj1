Utility Models



Utility Models and Goals

A goal is a restrictive measure of how 
good a plan is.  Preference or utility models can be arbitrarily expressive about 
plan quality, but how do you use them to generate plans?
   
 Work with 
         Peter Haddawy 
          explores the form of 
         utility models 
         that incorporate traditional symbolic goals with information 
         about temporal deadlines, partial satisfaction, and resource 
         consumption. Publications include:
          
  Issues in Decision-Theoretic Planning:  Symbolic Goals and Numeric 
                  Utilities, which appears in the Proceedings of the 1990 
                  DARPA Planning Workshop,
             Representations for Decision-Theoretic Planning:  Utility
                     Functions for Deadline Goals which appears in the 
                     KR92 Proceedings, 
            
 Utility Models for Goal-Directed Decision-Theoretic Planners,
                   which is under review for journal publication.
          

 Work with  Mike Williamson
           explores how these formal models can be integrated with a least-commitment 
           planning algorithms.  The result is PYRRHUS, a planner that generates optimal 
           plans in a delivery-truck domain (using the  Truckworld
           testbed.  See 
           
 Optimal Planning with a Goal-Directed Utility Model,
                   which appeared in the AIPS94 proceedings.
