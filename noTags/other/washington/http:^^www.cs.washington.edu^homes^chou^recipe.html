Stir-fried Taiwanese Rice Sticks
BBQ beef skewers


These are two of my most popular recipes.  If I can't find a job after I 
get my degree, maybe I'll open a restaurant and sell these dishes.




Stir-fried Taiwanese Rice Sticks


(pronounced [-tsa -vee \hoon ])

Rice sticks are thin noodles made with rice.  I use the term rice 
sticks as opposed to rice noodles because not only do the packages say so, 
but it's more specific.  You could try fatter rice noodles with this 
recipe but I don't think they would taste as good.


Warning: This dish is very difficult to cook!  But the result
  will be highly rewarding.


 Ingredients:

 1 pack of thin rice sticks (makes 6 servings)
   1/2 lbs of lean pork
	      (for vegetarin dish, substitute pork with regular
	       mushrooms or dried tofu)
   soy sauce
   corn starch
   10 dried shiitake mushrooms
   1-2 carrots
   3-4 stalks of celery
   vegetable oil
   sesame/cotton seed oil
   cilantro
   1 egg


Note: most ingredients are optional.

 Steps: 

 Slice the pork into thin 1-inch strips.  Add 2
   tablespoons soy sauce and a few drops of sesame oil.
   Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes, but
   preferably several hours or overnight.  Optionally add
   a teaspoon black vinegar.

 Soak the dried shiitake mushrooms in hot water for a few hours
    and slice.  Marinate with 1/2 tablespoon of soy sauce,
    3 teaspoons of corn starch, and a few drops of sesame oil.

 Slice the celery and carrots into thin 1-2 inch sticks.

  If you are using a non-stick pot or wok for stir-frying,
   then soak the rice sticks in cold water until they
   turn soft and drain the water. (between 5-10 minutes)
   If you are using a sticky pot or wok for stir-frying,
   then soak the rice sticks in the hot water (note: do not
   boil the rice sticks!) until the rice sticks become soft.
   The actual time depends on specific type of rice sticks,
   and is around 3 minutes.

 Stir-fry the mushrooms in medium heat with 3 tablespoons
   of oil for 5 minutes.  Note: heat up the pan before
   adding oil, and add the mushrooms immediately so that the oil
   does not burn.
   Remove the mushrooms.  Stir-fry the pork for 1 minute.
   Mix 1 tablespoon of corn starch with 2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce,
   pour over the pork, and continue stir-frying for 2-3 minutes.
   Add the mushrooms back in and mix.

 Remove the pork and the mushrooms from the pot, but keep the
   liquid in the pot.  Add the rice sticks and mix so that the
   rice sticks acquire the color of the soy sauce evenly.
   Add the carrot and celery sticks and mix well. 
   If you are using a non-stick pot/wok and soaked the rice sticks
   in hot water, then you need to start stir-frying the rice sticks
   as soon as they turn soft; stir-fry them for 5-10 minutes.
   But if you have a sticky pot/wok and soaked the rice sticks in
   cold water, then you don't have to cook them right way, but
   it takes longer (10-15 minutes) to stir-fry.


 Before serving, add some ground pepper and fresh cilantro.
   Add slices of an omlet and serve.

Remarks: This dish is difficult because of the delicate
nature of the rice sticks.  It requires precise timing.
The rice sticks should not be greasy or too moist, and
should not break into pieces on contact (overcooked).



BBQ Beef Skewers

Ingredients Marinate:

Beef tri-tip meat.  Or you can use ribs.
Premium Taiwanese soy sauce.
   I would not recommend Japanese soy sauce, which tends to be much saltier.
>garlic.  Use at least 3-4 cloves
green onions: Use 3-4
sesame oil:  Use at least 1 tablespoon

Secret Ingredients

frozen concentrated pineapple juice: 1-2 tablespoons.

Taiwanese barbecue sauce
  (, pronounced [=sa -day]):
  use 1-2 tablespoons.
  
  it's a dark brown sauce soaked in oil.  It's made with benito (a kind of 
  fish), garlic, and other spices.
  I don't really use that oil for marinating.
  This sauce may be a little hard to find in your local
  supermarkets, but should be easy to find in the International District.
  You should refrigerate it after opening.
  I would recommend the "Bull-head" brand.

Steps

Slice the beef into 1/8"-thick by 1"-wide strips before marinating.

To make the marinate, crush the garlic with a knife and remove the skin.
Cut the green onions into about 3" long and slice lengthwise.
Mix the rest of the ingredients well with the meat and let
it sit overnight in the fridge (minimum 4 hours).
  If you let it sit too long (2 days) it can get too salty.

You can also try orange juice or lemon juice but I like
   pineapple juice the best.  Grape juice doesn't work too well
   though.

Load the skewers with beef, maybe interleaved with other vegetables, 
within 30 minutes prior to grilling.  Grill for 3 minutes, turn over for 
and other 2-3 minutes, and it should be ready to eat.

Alternative Serving Suggestions

You can eat the meat directly off the skewers, or toss in salad.  If you 
have any leftover raw beef that's alraedy marinated (extremely unlikely), 
you can actually pan fry the beef without oil for 5 minutes.  You can pour 
the juice over salad and mix with some wasabi.  If a beef slice is too 
large then you can cut it into smaller strips.
