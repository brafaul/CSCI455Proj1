Mossy Bits



Welcome to Mossy Bits

   Mossy Bits is the Computer Science and Engineering department's
nearly annual graduate student online creative arts journal.  This
journal is intended to be a creative outlet for the department's
graduate students, and nearly all forms of creativity are appreciated.
Past submissions have included poetry, short fiction, essays,
travelogues, contests, music, drawings, photography, and computer art,
but anything that is reasonably entertaining and is transmissable over
the Web is fair game.

Little is known about the origins of Mossy Bits.  It was originally
a spoof of the department's far more sensibly named newsletter, Most
Significant Bits.  It has since undergone various modifications and
mutations, including the change to a Web format last year.  Since this
format allows submissions that would never have been publishable on
paper, such as music and animation, and allows far more people to view
the journal, Mossy Bits will continue to be published on the Web for
some time.  

   So welcome, and we hope you enjoy our journal.  If you have any
questions, comments, complaints, or suggestions, feel free to email us
at mossy-bits@cs.washington.edu.
