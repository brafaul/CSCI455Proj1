  Runtime Code Generation (RTCG)  

Runtime Code Generation (RTCG)
Terms
Runtime Code Generation (RTCG) is a general name
for structured techniques that change a program's instruction space
while the program is running.
There are a variety of other common, overlapping names,
such as ``dynamic compilation'' and ``self-modifying code'';
there are also a variety of other less-polite names.

The term "demand-driven compilation" is narrower than RTCG.
It typically means that some or all parts of the language translation
process are performed on a unit of code when that unit is invoked.
Demand-driven compilation may be contrasted with runtime code
generation that is performed speculatively; with demand-driven dynamic
linking in which the address space is modified without "compilation";
and self-modifying code in which a code unit is updated by itself
which, necessarily, is after the unit has been invoked.

The term dynamic compilation is also narrower,
typically encompassing code that is generated dynamically
but which does not self-modify.
Dynamic compilation is most often applied to systems using
general-purpose in-core code generators
and performing code generation over sophisticated inputs
(e.g., expressions, rather than simple values)
or over dynamically-loaded source code or pseudocode.
(Beware that the term ``dynamic compilation'' is nowadays often(?)
used also to mean ``a compilation of literary works which is done on
an ongoing and/or incremental basis'',
e.g. here.)
Dynamic linking adds code to the instruction space of the
program.
The code is typically generated using a code generator that is outside
of the program.
The ``new code'' may have been generated on demand for the
application;
dynamically-linked code is also used to implement
language-independent enhancement and extension, to elilminate
machine-dependencies from binaries, and to reduce the size of
binaries.
(Unfortunately, the term is also sometimes used to describe
``building hypermedia connections on an ongoing or incremental
basis''.)

The term runtime compilation is often used to describe
loop parallelization that is done at runtime
and which performs no code generation.
The idea of runtime compilation
is that loop-carried data dependencies for,
e.g., ``x[i] = y[i+2] + z[i-5]''
can be discovered by a static compiler,
but that,
e.g., ``x[a[i]] = y[a[i+2]] + z[a[i-5]]''
cannot.
The system thus examines the values of a at runtime,
and performs parallelization at runtime, based on the values.
The system thus ``compiles'' information at runtime but
performs no code generation.

to Shun-Tak Leung (shuntak@cs.washington.edu)
for more information.
Instruction-Space Modification is a general term,
including any topic that changes bits in an instruction space,
whether the change comes from inside the application or from
outside.
Just-In-Time Comiplation (JIT) is the general idea that some
steps of compilation may be deferred until the code is invoked.
At the moment (1996)
most systems that use "JIT" by name are systems
that use dynamic compilation to get good performance from a portable
(machine and/or OS-independent) program representation.
Typically, the unit of translation is a loadable unit, or smaller;
for example, modules, procedures, statements, etc.,
and the input is some virtual machine byte code
rather than source text, trees, etc.
JIT is used to refer to code generation at dynamic link time as well
as invocation time.
In contrast, many other systems perform compilation "just in time"
but with the goal of fine-tuning machine-dependent code, etc.
A more preceise (but longer) name for "classical" JIT is probably
something like:
"demand-driven specialization to processor architecture
at the [module|procedure|...] level".


The term self-modifying code or SMC also refers to RTCG
but it is harder to pin down because
there are many interpretations of ``modify''
and so many ways to pronounce ``self''.
``Modification'' may mean that an instruction is executed,
manipulated in place, and then executed again;
it may mean that a region of memory is reused,
and holds several instructions over its lifetime;
or, it may mean that the instruction space changes,
even if no part of it is reused.
As for the problem with ``self'', Adam Kao phrased it nicely:


What I'm trying to say is, what constitutes ``self'' and ``other''
depends on your point of view.
...
Try this simple exercise.
Point a finger at your belly-button.
Poke.
You poked yourself.
Your finger didn't poke itself.


Some various sensible interpretations include:
(a) instructions that manipulate themselves;
(b) instructions that manipulate other instructions in the same basic
block;
(c) instructions from one source code module manipuate other
instructions in the same module
(d) instructions in one module manipulte instructions
that are created on behalf of that module;
(e) instructions in one address space manipulate other instructions in
the same address space;
(f) instructions in one protection somain mainpulate other
instructions in the same protection domain
(g) instructions being used to solve onen problem manipulate
instructions that are also used to solve the same problem.

The terms code and data are used here in a limited
sense.
``Code'' is used to refer to native machine code that is executable
except that it may live in a data space instead of a code space.
``Data'' is used to refer to all other state, including bits in an
instruction space that are not executable (e.g. are not well-formed
instructions) and things that will be manipulted to become code but
which are not yet executable native machine code.
These definitions are limited because a more general definition of
``code'' defines it relative to some engine of execution.
In particular, ``code'' in a more general sense might include virtual
machine code instructions, source text, etc.
and might also include data values that are used to affect processor
execution in specific ways.

	environment into a persistent store with the variables defined
	within them, and later loaded into a runtime environment.
