First Lisp Assignment







    
 Next:  Establishing your MSCC 
  
  CS341, Spring 1996 
LISP Assignment #0 
Assigned 3/25, (not to hand in).



The Assignment:
 Set up your MSCC account 
    (instructions here) and log on.
 Register yourself on the class mailing list
    (instructions here).
 Find the Course Web.  Hint:  
http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/341/

 Look at the tutorial on how to use the 
      Lisp/Emacs interface
      on the Course Web.   Follow the instructions in the  Getting
      started section for setting up the initialization files.
 Start Emacs.
 Open a buffer for a new Lisp code file called 
program.lisp
 
to hold the code for the first asssignment.  You should notice on the 
Emacs status line at the bottom of the window that 
a lot of ``fi'' code is getting loaded into Emacs.
(``Fi'' stands for ``Franz interface,'' and this is the Emacs code 
that manages the Lisp editor buffers and the interaction between Lisp 
and the editor.)

 Type in the simple program here.   
(You don't have to type in the comments if you don't want.)
The main thing to notice while you're doing this is 
that the Emacs editor will help by indenting your code for you.  
Every time you hit a carriage return it will indent you on the next line.
If you don't see the same indentation pattern as in the sample code, 
you probably have too many or two few parentheses.

 Although you have now written a Lisp program, you are not 
yet running the Lisp interpreter, so there's nobody around to 
appreciate your great typing job.  Start a Lisp process now, as per 
the instructions in the 
Lisp/Emacs tutorial.

 Evaluate the program code. 
Instructions here; 
also see the tutorial.  You have now 
defined several functions, one for each  defun in the 
program file, but you really only want to run one of them.

 Run the code by typing in 
(play-one-round)

(Upper or lower case, it doesn't matter.)
You will get an error message. Try to figure out what is causing it.

 Fix the error in your editor buffer, re-load the buffer 
and run the function again.  Have fun playing this exciting 
game!

 The format function is a built-in Lisp function that does
formatted output.  Try to figure out how it works.  (Hint:  
use the Common Lisp manual to get the manual page for  format. 
The tutorial will tell you how.
We'll discuss it in class.

 If you're feeling bold, put all your new knowledge together and 
write your first Lisp program.  Write
a function that takes two numbers as arguments and prints their sum.
It should behave something like this:
    USER(1): (print-sum 2 -7)
    The sum of 2 and -7 is -5.
    NIL
    USER(2):

(The USER(1): is just a prompt from Lisp telling you it's waiting 
for input.)

 Discussion question for class:  what is this NIL thing, 
and why do we keep seeing it??!?
