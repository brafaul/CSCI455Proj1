Assignment 2 Solution Set

Prove that  for all .

We can prove this by induction on i:

Basis: The statement is true for i = 0 because  for
any x and so

Inductive hypothesis: Assume that the statement is true for i=k:

Inductive step: From this we need to show it is true for i=k+1:

By induction, the statement is true for all .

 Regular expressions
 The set of strings over  that contain the substring aa exactly once:

 The set of strings over  that do not contain the substring aa:

 The set of strings over  where the total number of a's and
b's is 3:


 
Consider the equation:

where A and B are fixed sets and X is a set variable.  Assume that
B is not empty.  
 Argue that  is a solution to the equation.

To do this, we verify that  below:


 Argue that if X solves the equation, then .

Let X be a solution to the equation.
One way of proving that  
is by showing that  for
any .  Intuitively, we can see this by substituting
 for X into the equation a few times:

First we notice that  = X, so it must be true that
.  Similarly, after the first substitution we can say that
, so
.  Thus, for any i we can apply i substitutions to
get . The union of these is also a subset of X, so



The answer above is all I really wanted, 
although to be truly formal we should prove 
that  for all  by induction:

Basis: We know that  from above.
Inductive hypothesis: Assume  for some .
Inductive step: From the inductive hypothesis, we know that
.  This means there must be some Y where 
.  Substituting this into the equation we get
.  
From this we can see that that  .

Therefore,  for all .
