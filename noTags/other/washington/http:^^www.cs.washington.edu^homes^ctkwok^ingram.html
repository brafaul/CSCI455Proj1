The Ingram softbot





TheINGRAMsoftbot project



Ingram is an INformation GatheRing Agent called ingraM.  The user can specify the information 
he or she in 
terms of a database query and Ingram will try its best to use all kinds of deviated methods
not unlike those in the Internet hunt to obtain the information.

Ingram is different from many other similar projects in many ways.  Ingram is designed to
be small,  efficient and distributed,  so that eventually it can reside on the web as a
java application.  Dream on.

At the core of Ingram is a forward chaining planner Occam.  Occam is novel in that it 
performs heuristic search on database objects.  Occam is a joint work with 
Dan Weld,  
and recently we co-authored a paper on Occam that was accepted to appear in AAAI96.
