Assignment 8

Consider the NFA  where  is
given by the table:


Use the ``practical'' form of the subset construction to produce a DFA
equivalent to M.


For the NFA M of problem 1 use the regular expression diagram method to
construct a regular expression equivalent to M.  Be sure to
simplify regular expressions when possible.

Number 7 (c) on page 182.  Start with an NFA M which accepts L,
then show the construction of an NFA  which accepts .
Carefully state a behavioral lemma which relates the behavior of M
with the behavior of .  Use the behavioral lemma to prove that
.  Do not prove the behavioral lemma, but be sure that
you could do so.
