Family History

Opal is a descendant of a number of object-oriented distributed
systems built at UW during the 1980s.  Following are some
references to some of those systems. 

 E. Jul, H. Levy, N. Hutchinson, A. Black.  
Fine-Grained Mobility in the Emerald
System. ACM Trans. on Computer Systems 6(1), February 1988.
(Emerald is a distributed object-oriented language and system supporting
a single, logical, distributed, object address space.  It was the first
system with on-the-fly object mobility.  Protection is guaranteed by 
the language and compiler.)

 J. Chase, F. Amador, E. Lazowska, H. Levy, R. Littlefield.
The Amber System: Parallel Programming on a Network
of Multiprocessors. Proc. of the 12th ACM Symp. on Operating
Systems Principles, December 1989. (Amber is a distributed object-oriented
system, based on C++, for writing parallel programs that execute on 
a local-area network;  Amber uses a single shared distributed address 
space above which C++ objects are supported.)
