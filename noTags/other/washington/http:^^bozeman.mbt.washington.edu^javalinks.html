UW Java Programming Language Email Conference

I've set up a listproc discussion group/email conference on the
Java Programming language.  
[Thanks to cac. Cool service & easy to use].
It's intended for folks here at the
U but registration is not limited and the conference is not 
moderated.  
To subscribe send email to 

   listproc@u.washington.edu 

containing only
the line 

   subscribe java_lang &ltyour name here>

This group should
be smaller and more newbie-friendly than the usenet conference comp.lang.java,
which is also recommended.




Ports


OSF is coordinating a bunch of ports.  
You can download [at no charge ] the software from the OSF Open Mall at
http://www.osf.org/mall/

Linux link?



Psst!

Actually, Java is an island in the archipelago that forms the
republic of

Indonesia.  It's has the fourth largest population of any
nation, enormous oil reserves, great 

music
and a horrific level of 

political violence.
Ever heard of 

East Timor?
