 Current Life (or lack thereof):
These days just about all my waking hours are spent working in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering at the University of Washington.  I have 
not been here nearly long enough to figure out exactly what I want to do, 
but my current interests lie in operating systems, namely 
SPIN. 



When I miraculously escape from the 
Chateau 
Office Complex  adjoining Sieg Hall, I try to remain relatively active.  
I am somewhat active on the 
CSE Racquetball 
Ladder, so throw challenges my way anytime.  I would also love to play 
golf sometime, but I don't know where to go and I have no way of getting 
there!  


 Very Current Life:  If you want to know what I'm 
really doing right now, check if I'm in my 
office.


 Past Life:

Before I wandered out to Seattle, I graduated with
a B.S in Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame.  You could say,
however, that I defected to the 
Department of Computer Science and Engineering, where I gained some
research experience.
Also at Notre Dame, I was an avid member of the Notre Dame Bands.
I will always remain a faithful supporter of the 
Fighting Irish (despite the meager chances of a 1996 National 
Championship), and I especially enjoyed the exciting October 12, 1996 
meeting with the Huskies of the University of Washington, where the Irish 
fared pretty well.

 GO IRISH!!!
