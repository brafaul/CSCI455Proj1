Experimental Analysis of Treecodes




Experimental Analysis of Treecodes for Astronomical Simulations


 The introduction of hierarchical tree data-structures to solve the
  N-body problem have led to a host of algorithms with asymptotic
  complexities ranging from O(n log  n) to 
 O(n). Although the asymptotic complexity of different
treecodes are
  competitive, the constant factors between the algorithms
  have a significant impact on the CPU time. In this paper
  we examine the performance of a class of treecodes to compare the
  effectiveness of different tree structures for N-body simulation.
  We investigate the performance of these treecodes in both the serial
  and parallel cases.


This work is in 
connection with a project on 

data structures by Prof. 
Richard Anderson.  
A draft
paper is also available.

I have also put together a simple applet that animates an 
N-body simulation.
