CSE 143 Class Messages

This page contains information on how to subscribe to course
mailing lists.  You should subscribe to at least 4 mailing lists -
cse143, cse143-announce, the list for your computing platform, and the
one for your section.


Limitations of E-mail

A caveat about mailing lists: Mailing lists have their strong points,
but generally speaking, you'll get a lot more help via direct, human
interaction.  Go to office hours, go to the lab and talk to a
consultant, TA, or instructor.  In particular, it is nearly impossible
to debug programs via email; so taking those kinds of questions
directly to a human is the best approach.  Finally, you should
never post homework related code to any mailing list.



How do I subscribe?

To subscribe to a mailing list, send e-mail to
majordomo@cs.washington.edu;
with the line subscribe listname in the message's
body (not its header), where listname is the name of
the list you want to join.

For example, to subscribe to a standard set of groups, send mail to
majordomo with the contents

subscribe cse143
subscribe cse143-announce
subscribe cse143-mac
subscribe cse143-section-ta-lastname


Within a moment, you should receive a response confirming your
addition to the list.


Avoid Embarrassment!!! When subscribing to a list,
make sure you send your "subscribe" message to majordomo@cs -- not to
the mailing list!  Otherwise you'll send a message to all the students
already on the list.



If you want to leave a list, send an "unsubscribe" message to
majordomo instead.
