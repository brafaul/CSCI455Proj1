Upper and Lower Bounds on Constructing Alphabetic Binary Trees

Abstract:
This paper studies the long-standing open question of whether
optimal alphabetic binary trees can be constructed in  
time.  We show that a class of techniques for 
finding optimal alphabetic trees which includes all current 
methods yielding  time algorithms are at least
as hard as sorting in whatever model of computation is used.
We also give  time algorithms for the case where all the input
weights are within a constant factor of one another and when
they are exponentially separated.
