Pictures from Summer 1996

Here are a few pictures from last summer:



This is a picture we took at Cannon Beach.  Cannon Beach is about 90 minutes
west of Portland along the Oregon coast.  Next to it is Seaside with
nice stores and a really cool place which sells interesting t-shirts... 





Another picture from cannon beach.





Yet another picture from cannon beach...





Here are the geeks I hung out with over the summer. :)





This picture was taken in Lincoln city, south of Cannon Beach.  In addition
to the nice beach, Lincoln city has good hiking trails passing through
rainforests.
