The Guggenheim Annex East Wing Gallery Page


Guggenheim Annex East Wing Gallery West Wall Project


The Guggenheim Annex ("Chateau") Gallery was created to give a voice to 
starving 
artists/students banished to Sieg Hall's Guggenheim Annex.  Here, the residents
are encouraged to express their ideas and frustrations through creative work. 
The west wall project of the East Wing is the first of these ambitious 
exhibits, focusing primarily on themes of Chateau living and feeling.  
The west wall will have its official opening in late November of 1995, but we
offer a sneak preview of some of the works below:
