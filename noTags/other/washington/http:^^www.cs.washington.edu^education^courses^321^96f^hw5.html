Due: Friday, November 1, 1996.



Reading Assignment: Read handout on induction proofs for recursively defined
sets and sections 4.1-4.4 of the text.
The following problems are from the Third Edition of the text.
 

Practice Problems: page 210, problem 31;
 Problems: 

 page 209, Problem 4.
 page 209, Problem 10.
 Give a recursive definition of the set of strings over alphabet
A={a,b} that have an even number of a's.  (You don't need to prove that it is
correct.)
 Define a set of strings S by:

 1 is in S
 If x is in S and y is in S then the string x0y is in S
 (And no other strings are in S)

Give a recursive proof that every string in S has exactly one more 1 than it
has 0's.
 page 241, Problems 8, 12, and 20
 page 242, Problem 42.  (A restriction to 8 character variable names 
is one reason why the names of all those Unix commands are so obscure.)
 (Bonus) page 242, Problem 48.  (They just mean one column of the
truth table.)
 (Bonus) page 249, Problem 20.
