MetaCrawler Configuration






METACRAWLER
Configuration Options 

This page is for users who wish to personalize
MetaCrawler.  Many features can be tailored to function the way
you desire.
To configure MetaCrawler, simply select the options you prefer, and then
click the Save Configuration button.
MetaCrawler will remember the options you choose, and next time
you visit our site the configuration will be the same.
Technical note: If your browser does not support Cookies, the
configuration will not be saved properly.  The solution is to bookmark
the link produced after saving the configuration and using
this bookmark to access MetaCrawler in the future.



Extra Functionality


Enable

Some features supported by MetaCrawler are not displayed by default.  This
option will allow the user to utilize this extra functionality.


Dynamic Status Displays


Enable

If you have a Java
capable browser, you may wish to view your search results
with the MetaCrawler control applet.  This allows you to request results
updates at any time during a search.  Java capable browsers include 
Netscape
Navigator version 2.0 and greater and 
Internet Explorer 
version 3.0 and greater.
Note for Internet Explorer users: Internet Explorer version 3.0
will crash when it tries to run our applet.  Please either turn off
Java just-in-time compilation or upgrade to Internet Explorer
version 3.01.


Frame Support


Enable

If Dynamic Status Displays are enabled above, the display applet may be located
in a 

frame
of its own, which allows the user to scroll through search results
while still viewing search progress. Note that some versions of Netscape
will not save your place after following a link out of a frame, a potential
annoyance.


Link Targets



Same windowSame frameNew window


If frame support is enabled above, the default is to replace the search page
with the target page when links are followed.  You may optionally choose to
display these results in the same frame as the followed link, or even in an
entirely new window.
