CSE 373 G++ Tips


Using the g++ Compiler

Related Information on C++
Here is a primer on C++

In class, several students mentioned a desire for some material
on pointers in C.  Here is a URL for a document dealing specifically
with pointers in C.
Information about pointers in C.

A Test program: "Hello-cse373.cpp"

Here is a sample C++ program.
Assume it is in a file named Hello-cse373.cpp.

#include "iostream.h"

void main(void) {
 cout << "Hello, CSE 373!";
 cout << " This is Autumn ";
 cout <<  1990 + 6;
}

Compiling and Running the Program


To compile the program on Entropy or Hilbert, type in the command,

%  g++ Hello-cse373.cpp


Then to run the program, type

%  a.out


Note: if you receive the following warning message, ignore it.
This message seems to reflect a minor problem with the MSCC
setup.  The user program runs alright anyway.  (On the CSE
Unix machine that I tried this program on, there was no such
warning message.)


/bin/ld:
Warning: Linking some objects which contain exception information sections
        and some which do not. This may cause fatal runtime exception handling
        problems (last obj encountered without exceptions was /usr/local/lib/libstdc++.a).
