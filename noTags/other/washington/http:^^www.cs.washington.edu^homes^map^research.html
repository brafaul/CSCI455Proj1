I'm a third-year graduate student here in the 

Department of Computer Science and Engineering
at the University of Washington. I'm pursuing a PhD in computer science, 
specifically in 

artificial intelligence.
Within the field of artificial intelligence, I am particularly 
interested in learning and am working on the 

Softbots project.


I'm currently working on intelligent user interfaces for
the WWW.



I've recently worked on the 
Internet Learning Agent.


I once worked on Equations for Part-of-Speech Tagging
(abstract and
postscript) with 
Eugene Charniak.


I'm part of the ongoing project ACRONYM: a lightweight extensible
agent-based object-oriented operating system for mobile wireless distributed 
computing supporting pseudo real-time interactive multimedia 
applications.
