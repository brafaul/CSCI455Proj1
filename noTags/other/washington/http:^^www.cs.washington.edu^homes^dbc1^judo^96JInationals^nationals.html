Pictures from the 1996 USJI Senior Nationals



1996 USJI Senior National Judo Championships
April 11-13 1996 - San Jose, California



The floor of the San Jose State Event Center


I recently had the opportunity to go to my first national tournament, and
competed Friday afternoon in the Men's -95kg division. I won my first match,
but lost my second, so I had some time to snap a few pictures. I figure one
of two things will happen: either I practice and get better at judo or I get
more practice taking pictures. In any case, the camcorder ran out of juice
filming the morning competition, so you won't be able
to evaluate my judo - but the pictures are here for all to see.
