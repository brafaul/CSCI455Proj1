Pronouncing "Shuichi"



How to pronounce "Shuichi"
Or,
Feeling weird at 3am in the morning


The name Shuichi is Japanese.  In Japan,
male names often signify expectations that the parents have of him.

Take, for example, my name.  The japanese character breakdown is:


The first character, pronounced shu (or, perhaps,
shoe), is the Japanese character for
outstanding.

The second character, pronouned ichi, is the Japanese
character for the number one, which signifies that I was the
first-born.

So, since my parents had expected great things out of me, and I was
the first-born child, my name is Shuichi.
