Automated Travel Assistant








The Automated Travel Assistant is a current research project
by the 

Artificial Intelligence group in the

Department of Computer Science and Engineering

at the

University of Washington.
The Automated Travel Assistant is being developed in
cooperation with the 

Internet Travel Network
and the American Airlines 

SABRE group.

Real time airline flight data is generously being provided by ITN.






ATA models the dialogue between a travel agent and client.
The system minimizes the amount of information initialized specified
by the user, offers several example flights from the large space of
potential flights, and assists the user in iteratively refining his
expressed preferences until an optimal flight is found.

Future enhancements include offering advice and recommending
alternative flight itineraries, enhancements to the UI for specifying
preferences, and a more sophisticated model of the cost and value of
information.








Instructions

Walkthrough


The applet takes approximately one minute to load.  Queries typically take
approximately 2-5 minutes to hit the database, processes the trips, and
display the results.








You're not Java capable!  Sorry, no cool applets for you.








Under construction...






This applet is a prototype of the system.  The interaction with the
system is currently limited to modifying the price and airline
constraints at the trip level and price, airline, and airport
constraints at the flight level.  
Keep an eye on this place.  Changes
should be happening rapidly.
