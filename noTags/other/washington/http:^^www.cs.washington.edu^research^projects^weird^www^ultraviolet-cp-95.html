Abstract

ENVY/Constraints is an IBM/Smalltalk library that provides a constraint
satisfier and a collection of useful constraints, targeted at developing
interactive graphical user interfaces.  The solver supports multi-way
constraints and constraint hierarchies.  It uses a hybrid algorithm,
combining local propagation with pluggable cycle solvers, allowing
constraints to range over arbitrary objects, while at the same time
satisfying constraints representing simultaneous equations over the reals.
