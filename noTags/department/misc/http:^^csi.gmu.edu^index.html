Computational Sciences and Informatics

 

Welcome to the home page of the Institute for Computational Sciences
and Informatics at 
George Mason University. 

The Institute for Computational Sciences and Informatics (CSI)
is an independent Ph.D. granting research institute within the University.
The Institute's program faculty is composed of several members from 
CSI, as well as from other departments at George Mason University 
and other research institutes in the Washington DC area. 

The goal of CSI is to develop new approaches to education and
scientific research that take advantage of the rapidly evolving high 
performance computational and communications technologies.
